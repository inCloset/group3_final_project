The CPUs and other semiconductor solutions that we design, manufacture, market, and sell are incorporated in computing and related end products and services, and utilized globally by consumers, enterprises, governments, and educational organizations. Customers of our semiconductor products primarily include OEMs, ODMs, cloud service providers, and other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. We market and sell our semiconductor products directly through our global sales and marketing organizations and indirectly through channel partners. We also develop semiconductor fabrication process and packaging technologies and manufacture many of our semiconductor product offerings at our geographically diverse network of fabrication and assembly and test facilities. We are also seeking to expand as a third-party foundry for external customers. Our StrategyTechnology permeates every aspect of our lives and is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence. As we look ahead to the next decade, we expect to see continued demand for processing power. Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering this digital expansion, and we are strategically positioning ourselves to create a resilient global semiconductor supply chain by investing in geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. The demand for compute is being accelerated by five superpowers: ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. Together, these superpowers combine to amplify and reinforce each other, and increase the world's need for computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever-smaller microchips. We harness these superpowers for our customers' growth and our own.We are uniquely positioned with the depth and breadth of our silicon, platforms, software, and packaging and process technology with at-scale manufacturing. With these strengths and the tailwinds of the superpowers driving digital disruption, our strategy to win is focused on four key themes: product competitiveness, open platforms, manufacturing at scale, and our people. Our PrioritiesProduct CompetitivenessLead and democratize compute with Intel x86 and xPU. Our product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from data center to network, PCs, edge computing, and the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, to serve an increasingly smart and connected world.At our core is the x86 ecosystem, which has served as a foundation of modern computing for over four decades. We continue to advance this ecosystem with x86 microarchitectures focused on performance and efficiency. In 2024, we announced the creation of an advisory group to expand the x86 ecosystem by enabling compatibility across platforms, simplifying software development, and providing developers with a platform to identify architectural needs and features to create innovative and scalable solutions for the future.   Beyond the CPU, we deliver a family of xPU products encompassing client and data center GPUs, IPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. The xPU approach recognizes that different workloads benefit from different computing architectures, and our broad portfolio helps meet our customers' increasingly diverse computing needs. As part of our strategy, we seek to develop and offer leading products across each of these architectural categories.We also seek to address every phase of the AI continuum, from the largest, most challenging GenAI and large language models to emerging usages like AI PCs and AI at the edge. We believe AI represents a generational shift in computing by expanding human abilities and solving the most challenging problems. We are in the early stages of realizing AI's full potential. Our strategy is to bring AI to where the data is being generated and used. We believe we have a full spectrum of hardware and software platforms that offer the open and modular solutions for competitive total cost of ownership and time to value that customers need to win in this era of exponential growth and AI everywhere. We are infusing AI into Intel technologies, supporting today's GenAI workloads, fueling emerging usages like AI PC and AI at the edge, and pioneering innovations that we believe will help advance the future of AI in the next decade. Our product offerings are predominantly manufactured in our own manufacturing facilities using our proprietary process technologies. In recent years, however, we have strategically utilized third-party foundry manufacturing capacity where advantageous for cost, performance, schedule, or other reasons. This provides increased flexibility and scale, including in recent years the ability to continue to offer various products at the most performant end of the product spectrum where we did not yet have comparable process technologies in-house.Open PlatformsWe aim to deliver open software and hardware platforms with industry-defining standards. Around the globe, companies are building their networks, systems, and solutions on open standards-based platforms. We have helped set the stage for this movement, with our historic contributions in developing standards such as CXL, Thunderbolt™, and PCI Express. We also contributed to the design, build, and validation of open-source products in the industry such as Linux, Android, and others. Our Strategy3We deliver open-source code and optimizations that are designed for projects across numerous platforms and usage models. We are committed to co-engineering and jointly designing, building, and validating new products with software industry leaders to accelerate mutual technology advancements and help software and hardware work better together. Manufacturing at Scale We manufacture a majority of our products in our own manufacturing facilities using our proprietary process technologies. This enables us to optimize performance, shorten time-to-market for new product introductions, and more quickly scale products in high volume.Process technology. We continue to develop new generations of manufacturing process technology as we seek to realize the benefits from Moore’s Law, a law of economics predicted by Intel’s cofounder Gordon Moore more than 50 years ago. Realizing Moore’s Law results in economic benefits as we are able to either reduce a chip's cost as we shrink its size or increase functionality and performance of a chip while maintaining the same cost with higher density. This makes possible the innovation of new products with higher performance while balancing power efficiency, cost, and size to meet customers' needs. As of the end of 2024, our core products were manufactured on 300mm wafers, with a significant majority manufactured using our Intel 7 process node while we ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes into high volume.Factory network. Our global factory network has been foundational to our success, enabling product optimization, improved economics, and supply resilience. We operate wafer manufacturing facilities in the United States (Oregon and Arizona), Ireland, and Israel, assembly and testing facilities in Costa Rica, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and packaging facilities in the United States (New Mexico), Costa Rica, Vietnam, and Malaysia. We intend to remain a leading developer of process technology and a major manufacturer of semiconductors and we plan to continue to build the majority of our products in our factories.Foundry services. The very high capital requirements of modern leading-edge semiconductor process technology development and manufacturing, especially those nodes requiring EUV lithography such as Intel 4, Intel 3, Intel 18A and future nodes, require us to expand the use of our process technologies as they mature and grow the number of wafers produced beyond the expected growth for our own products. To this end, we are seeking to build a world-class foundry business also serving external customers and have made significant investments in ecosystem support to enable the usage of our manufacturing network by external customers. Our foundry offerings include four components: wafer fabrication, packaging, chiplets, and software and services. We intend to build our customers' silicon designs and deliver full end-to-end customizable products built with our advanced packaging technology. We plan to differentiate our foundry offerings from those of others through a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe available for customers globally, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other ecosystem IP. Our PeopleOur world-class talent is at the heart of everything we do. Together we strive to have a positive effect on business, society, and the planet. Delivering on our strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent from across the world. Our people build our technology, unlock new business opportunities, and work with our partners and customers to create global impact.Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace where the world’s best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet.Focus on Innovation and ExecutionWe are focused on executing our product and process roadmaps and our cadence of innovation. We have set a detailed process and packaging technology roadmap and announced key architectural innovations to further our goal of delivering competitive products in every area in which we compete. We leverage our Smart Capital approach to help us adjust quickly to opportunities in the market while managing our margin structure and capital spending. The key elements of Smart Capital include:▪Smart capacity investments. We are building out future manufacturing shell space, which gives us flexibility in how and when we bring additional capacity online based on milestone triggers such as product readiness, market conditions, and customer commitments. ▪Government incentives. We work with governments to advance and benefit from incentives for domestic manufacturing capacity for leading-edge semiconductors. ▪SCIP. We access strategically aligned private capital to increase our flexibility and help efficiently accelerate and scale manufacturing build-outs. Our SCIP program has supported the period of accelerated manufacturing investment that commenced in early 2021. We signed our latest SCIP agreement in the second quarter of 2024 and are not contemplating further transactions in the near term.▪Customer commitments. Our foundry business works closely with potential customers to obtain advance payments to secure capacity and participate in manufacturing capacity build-outs. This provides us with the advantage of committed volume, derisking investments while providing capacity corridors for our foundry customers.▪External foundries. We intend to continue our use of external foundries where their capabilities or capacities support our Intel Products businesses offerings.Our Strategy4Our CapitalWe deploy various forms of capital to execute our strategy in a way that seeks to reflect our corporate values, help our customers succeed, and create value for our stakeholders. CapitalStrategyValueFinancialLeverage financial capital to invest in ourselves and  optimize our portfolio, both to drive our strategy and long-term value creation.We strategically invest financial capital to continue to build our business and create long-term value for our stockholders.IntellectualInvest significantly in R&D and IP to enable us to deliver on our accelerated process technology roadmap and introduce leading x86 and xPU products.We develop IP to enable next-generation products, create synergies across our businesses, expand into new markets, and establish and support our brands.ManufacturingBuild manufacturing capacity efficiently to meet the growing long-term global demand for semiconductors.Our geographically balanced manufacturing scope and scale enable us to provide our customers with a broad range of leading-edge products and foundry capabilities.HumanBuild a diverse, inclusive, and safe work environment to attract, develop, and retain top talent needed to build transformative products.Our talented employees enable the development of solutions and enhance the intellectual and manufacturing capital critical to helping our customers.Social and RelationshipBuild trusted relationships for both Intel and our stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, customers, local communities, and governments.We collaborate to empower communities through education and technology and advance accountability and capabilities across our global supply chain.NaturalStrive to reduce our environmental footprint through efficient and responsible use of natural resources and materials used to create our products.We seek to mitigate climate and water impacts, achieve efficiencies, lower costs, and position ourselves to respond to the expectations of our stakeholders. Our Capital5Financial CapitalWe take a disciplined approach to our financial capital allocation strategy, which continues to focus on building stakeholder value and is driven by our priority to invest in the business. We also seek to optimize our portfolio, look for innovative ways to unlock value across our assets, and, from time-to-time, engage in mergers and acquisitions.Cash from Operating Activities $B■ Cash from Operating Activities■ Adjusted Free Cash Flow1Our Financial Capital Allocation StrategyInvest in the BusinessOur first allocation priority is to invest in R&D and capital spending to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the world's demand for semiconductors. In 2024, we continued our focus on capital investment and the deployment of our Smart Capital strategy. Return Excess Cash to StockholdersOur capital allocation strategy historically included returning excess cash to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Our most recent stock repurchase was in the first quarter of 2021 and we suspended the declaration of quarterly dividends starting with the fourth quarter of 2024. We agreed under our commercial CHIPS Act agreement to forgo paying dividends for the next two years, and agreed to limitations on the payment of dividends for the three years thereafter. Further, we do not expect to pay dividends or make stock repurchases until our cash flows improve as we focus on the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy and create long-term value. R&D and Capital Investments $BCash to Stockholders $B        ■ R&D■ Logic■ Memory2■ Repurchases■ DividendOptimize our Portfolio and Unlock ValueWe seek to drive value creation through transactions such as the 2022 IPO and 2023 secondary offering of Mobileye stock, the 2023 minority stake sales in IMS, and the 2023 announcement of our intent to operate Altera as a standalone business, which we expect to enable potential private and public equity investments. Transactions like these provide additional capital to support the critical investments needed to advance our business strategy.Our capital allocation strategy also includes opportunistic investment in and acquisition of companies that complement our strategic objectives. We look for acquisitions that supplement and strengthen our capital and R&D investments. Lastly, we take action when investments do not strategically align to our key priorities or provide adequate returns to our stakeholders. In the last few years, we exited numerous businesses, including our NAND Memory business (first closing in 2021 and second closing expected in March 2025) and our Intel® Optane™ memory business (2022).1 See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&A.2 2021-2024 capital investments in Memory are not presented due to the divestiture of the NAND memory business which we deconsolidated upon closing the first phase of the transaction on December 29, 2021. 2020 capital investments presented include Memory.  Our Capital6Intellectual CapitalResearch and DevelopmentR&D investment is critical to enable us to deliver on our technology roadmap, introduce leading products, and develop new businesses and capabilities in the future. We seek to protect our R&D efforts through our IP rights and may augment R&D initiatives by, from time-to-time, acquiring or investing in companies, entering into R&D agreements, and directly purchasing or licensing technology.Areas Key to Product CompetitivenessWe have intensified our focus and investment on areas key to product competitiveness. Our objective with each new generation of products is to improve user experiences and value through advances in performance, power, cost, connectivity, security, form factor, and other features. We also focus on reducing our design complexity, re-using IP, and increasing ecosystem collaboration to improve our efficiency.xPU. We believe the future is with xPU across a diverse mix of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial architectures deployed in CPU, GPU, NPU, IPU, accelerators, and FPGA sockets, enabled by a scalable software stack and integrated into systems by advanced packaging technology. We are building processors that span several major computing architectures, moving toward an era of heterogeneous computing: ▪Client CPUs. In 2024, we ramped sales of the Intel® Core™ Ultra Series 1, our first product with an integrated neural processing unit for efficient processing of AI workload. The Intel Core Ultra Series 1, manufactured on the Intel 4 process, introduced the first AI PCs to the market. We also launched the Intel Core Ultra 200V Series, showcasing power efficiency and long-lasting battery life. The 200V Series, manufactured by an external foundry, leverages our Xe2 GPU architecture, bringing improved efficiency, second-generation ray tracing units and XMX AI acceleration to thin and light notebooks. During 2024, a significant majority of our client sales consisted of our 13th and 14th Gen Intel Core processors, manufactured on Intel 7, which allow us to serve the breadth of customer and computing needs in the client market. ▪Data center CPUs. We launched our Intel® Xeon® 6 processors for the data center, utilizing the Intel 3 process, including our first Intel Xeon processor using Efficient cores (E-cores). The Intel Xeon 6 family is designed to address the growing diversity in workloads and deployments in the data center environments. Our 5th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors, based on Intel 7, were launched in 2023, and continued to ramp throughout 2024.  ▪Discrete client GPUs. The Intel® Arc™ graphics family offers modern GPU features to power immersive games, creator applications, and AI workloads. In 2024, we launched the Intel Arc B-Series based on the latest Xe2 GPU architecture. The compute engine of the Intel Arc B-Series is our second-generation Xe-core, which delivers 70% more performance per core and is 50% more power efficient than the Intel Arc A750.▪Edge computing. We recently launched a suite of processors for edge computing. This includes the Intel Core Ultra 200S Series, bringing the NPU IP to desktops and reducing package power. These hybrid designs utilize our most advanced performance cores and power-efficient cores, as well as the latest packaging technology.▪Datacenter AI accelerators and GPUs. In 2024, we launched the Intel® Gaudi® 3 AI accelerators offering significant price-performance advantages for AI inference applications.Software. Software unleashes the potential of our hardware platforms across all workloads, domains, and architectures.We aim to optimize AI frameworks and middleware, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, vLLM, Hugging Face and WebNN to run efficiently on our hardware. Our OpenVINO™ toolkit is an open source toolkit that accelerates deep learning inference on our processors across various use cases, such as generative AI, computer vision, audio, and language with industry standard models. It is used in domains from edge to AI PC to cloud and is the leading inferencing library on our silicon.In 2024 we launched the Open Platform for Enterprise AI under the Linux Foundation to accelerate deployment of generative AI use cases through industry standard modular microservice architecture. Since launch, the ecosystem has been actively engaged, with an expanding network of partners enhancing features and developing new capabilities.Most of these frameworks and middleware are built from our oneAPI, which enables developers to create performant cross-architecture applications using a single code base across CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators. We contributed our oneAPI specifications and implementations to the UXL Foundation under the Linux Foundation. By doing so, oneAPI delivers an open and multi-vendor programming model enabling choice and code re-use across the accelerator hardware ecosystem.This software stack is designed to preserve the usability of existing tools and software while accommodating future developments, enabling continuity for users and developers.Areas Key to Process and Packaging CompetitivenessOur leading-edge process and packaging technology continues to be key to the success of our strategy.▪Intel 7 process node continues in production for our 13th and 14th Gen Intel Core processors. Intel 7 was utilized for a significant majority of our processor production and products in 2024, and is expected to continue to be utilized for a significant portion of our processor production and products in 2025. Our Capital7▪Intel 4, our first EUV lithography node, delivers significant density scaling and approximately 20% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 7. The Intel Core Ultra processor is our first high-volume client product on Intel 4 and began shipping to customers in 2023. Intel 4 moved to high-volume manufacturing in Ireland in 2024, and is expected to represent an increasing portion of our processor production and products in 2025.▪Intel 3, our second EUV lithography node, delivers further logic scaling and up to 18% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 4. Intel 3 is offered to external foundry customers and is optimized for the needs of data center products. This node, which is produced in the same facilities as Intel 4, was in high-volume manufacturing in Oregon during 2024, with high-volume manufacturing shifted to Ireland for 2025. Intel’s Xeon 6 Scalable server processor offerings are built on this technology.▪Intel 18A is our next generation leading-edge process technology and has been designed to incorporate the first high volume commercial implementation of two breakthrough technologies: gate-all-around transistors and backside power. RibbonFET, our implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, is designed to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins, but in a smaller footprint. PowerVia is our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery that is designed to optimize signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer. Intel 18A is offered to external foundry customers and is designed to deliver improvements in performance per watt and density scaling over Intel 3. We expect to commence high-volume manufacturing of Panther Lake, our new client family of products and our first processors on Intel 18A, in 2025.  ▪Intel 14A, our third advanced process technology offering to external customers, is in active development with performance-per-watt and density scaling improvements over Intel 18A. IP RightsWe own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. We have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are granted. As we expand our product offerings, particularly around our foundry business, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties. The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.Efforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see \"Risk Factors\" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.Manufacturing CapitalWe are one of only a few companies in the world with the process technology and manufacturing facilities to produce leading-edge semiconductor logic chips.Process TechnologyOur technology development group, with its R&D and semiconductor fabrication facilities in Oregon, designs and develops each new process technology node before high-volume production is shifted to one of our high-volume manufacturing sites. With each new node, we seek improvements in performance, power efficiency, cost, and size to meet the needs of our products and of external foundry customers. The continued development of leading-edge nodes that are competitive with the offerings of other foundries requires significant ongoing capital investment as we pursue incremental improvements and refinements of existing transistor and layout designs and manufacturing technologies, such as EUV lithography, while also pursuing new transistor and layout designs, such as gate-all-around and backside power in our upcoming Intel 18A process node, and new manufacturing technologies, such as high-NA EUV lithography for use in our upcoming Intel 14A process node. As of the end of 2024, a significant majority of our products were manufactured using our Intel 7 process node in Arizona and Israel, we successfully ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes as our first EUV lithography nodes and shifted high-volume production of those nodes to Ireland, and we canceled the productization of our Intel 20A process node to focus efforts on the improved version of the node, Intel 18A, that we expect to put into high-volume production in 2025 with our new client family of products code-named Panther Lake.    Our Capital8Manufacturing Facilities  Our geographically distributed network of semiconductor manufacturing facilities and assembly and test facilities allows us to produce advanced semiconductor logic chips in high volume. After a process technology node is developed by our technology development group, we seek to shift production to one or more high-volume manufacturing facilities. Maintaining reliable production capacity is of critical importance. Wafer and packaging manufacturing facilities take a number of years to build, making it prudent to build space ahead of demand. We refer to this strategy as \"shell ahead.” As a result of the supply shocks driven by the Covid-19 pandemic and the projected growth of our products businesses, we set out to expand our capacity network beyond our existing wafer production facilities in Oregon (mostly utilized for technology development and early production on new nodes), Arizona, Ireland, and Israel to meet this demand and get to “shell ahead” status. We are in the later stages of an expansion of our wafer fabrication facilities in Ireland for our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes and undertaking a significant expansion of our Arizona facility for our upcoming Intel 18A process node. We are building a new wafer production facility in Ohio and have plans for an additional new wafer production facility in Germany, but have slowed the completion of the Ohio facility and put the plans for the facility in Germany on hold as we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and sought to limit our capital expenditures given recent financial results. We have assembly and test facilities in Costa Rica, China, Malaysia, New Mexico, and Vietnam. We are expanding our facilities in New Mexico and Malaysia, though we recently reduced the extent of the expansion plans for Malaysia. We have plans for an additional assembly and test facility in Poland, but have put those plans on hold in conjunction with the delay of the facility in Germany.  Semiconductor manufacturing requires extremely sophisticated equipment, and we work closely with the tool vendors to align their roadmaps to our needs. In 2024, we made the transition from non-EUV lithography to EUV lithography with the Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes. EUV lithography equipment drives a higher capital investment than the preceding lithography technology. Semiconductor manufacturing is a capital-intensive industry. Over the past four years, we have made outsized investments across three categories—technology development, manufacturing facility shells, and advanced production tools—as we aim to catch up with our leading third-party manufacturing competitor on process technology, get to \"shell ahead\" for our and potential future foundry customer needs, and adopt EUV lithography for our leading process nodes. In 2024, our manufacturing capital expenditures, inclusive of technology development, were distributed 55% in manufacturing facility space and 45% in equipment. To moderate the impact to our balance sheet and cash flows, we’ve implemented what we call Smart Capital. Smart Capital includes maintaining a \"shell ahead\" on the longer lead time space and delaying tool purchases as long as possible ahead of high confidence demand signals while leveraging capital offsets from governments, financial partners, and customers.We work closely with governments in the regions where we operate to obtain government incentives to support leading-edge semiconductor R&D and manufacturing in those regions. Such incentives are often needed to offset the higher costs of operations in such regions, and support a more geographically balanced and risk-tolerant semiconductor supply chain. We worked closely with the US federal government on the implementation of the CHIPS Act in support of the semiconductor industry and American technological leadership and innovation. In 2024, we signed an agreement with the US Federal Department of Commerce for the award of up to $7.9 billion in direct funding under the commercial CHIPS Act program, which is designed to support leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing in the US, as well as an agreement under which we may receive up to $3 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS Act's Secure Enclave program, which is designed to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the US government. We also expect and have begun to benefit significantly from the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit, given that the significant portion of our R&D and manufacturing investments are made in the United States.In 2024, as part of our SCIP program, we entered into an arrangement with Apollo in which we received a one-time capital infusion in exchange for an interest in the rights to operate Fab 34 in Leixlip, Ireland. This follows our first SCIP agreement, with Brookfield, completed in 2022 and relating to our Arizona facility expansion. In total, we expect greater than $25 billion of capital offsets through these partnerships. Finally, as we build out our external foundry services, we expect to receive customer pre-payments to secure capacity and other benefits. Customer pre-payments are a standard practice for semiconductor manufacturers. Supply ChainOur supply chain is a cornerstone of our success and a critical enabler of our mission to deliver cutting-edge technology solutions to our customers. Our global supply chain supports internal partners across architecture, product design, technology development, manufacturing and operations, and sales and marketing. It encompasses thousands of suppliers worldwide, forming a robust supply ecosystem designed to enable product and process competitiveness, deliver industry-leading total cost of ownership, and enable on-time, uninterrupted supply in a responsible and sustainable manner.Our global supply chain strategy is focused on driving a resilient, diverse, and responsible supply chain that meets the needs of our customers while upholding the highest standards of safety, quality, technology, availability, and sustainability. We work tirelessly across our supply chain to minimize disruptions, improve productivity, and optimize capacity utilization and output to meet customer expectations.  Our Capital9Human CapitalOur human capital strategy is grounded in our belief that our people are fundamental to our success. Delivering on our strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent across the world. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace where the world's best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet. We invest in our highly skilled workforce, which was comprised of 108,900 people as of December 28, 2024, by creating practices, programs, and benefits that support the evolving world of work and our employees' needs.Our values—customer first, fearless innovation, results driven, one Intel, inclusion, quality, and integrity—inspire us and are key to delivering on our purpose. All employees are responsible for upholding these values, the Intel Code of Conduct, and Intel's Global Human Rights Principles, which form the foundation of our policies and practices and ethical business culture.Talent ManagementWe continue to see significant competition for talent throughout the semiconductor industry. Our hiring was limited in 2024, in line with macroeconomic forecasts, financial performance, and cost-reduction measures, and we took headcount actions in connection with our  2024 Restructuring Plan that are expected to result in an approximate 15% decrease in our core Intel workforce by early 2025. However, the investments we are making to accelerate our process technology require continued and focused efforts to attract and retain talent—especially technical talent. Our undesired turnover rate1 was 5.9% in 2024 and 5.6% in 2023.We invest resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Intel an employer of choice. We offer training programs and provide rotational assignment opportunities and have updated our job architecture to help employees create custom learning curricula for building skills and owning their careers. To further support the growth and development of our people, we offer mentoring in our technical community, drive engagement through employee resource groups, and promote health and wellness resources to all our people. Through our annual employee experience survey, employee inclusion survey, and manager development feedback survey, employees can voice their perceptions of the company, their managers, their work experiences, and their learning and development opportunities. Our employees' voices are important to enable our culture of continuous improvement, and as a result, we link a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to year-over-year improvements of our employee experience survey results. Our performance management system is designed to support our cultural evolution and to increase our focus on disciplined execution.InclusionInclusion is a core element of Intel's values and instrumental to driving innovation and positioning us for growth. Over the past decade, we have taken actions to integrate diversity and inclusion expectations into our culture, performance and management systems, leadership expectations, and annual bonus metrics. Through our annual employee inclusion survey, employees can voice their experiences at Intel and provide feedback on how we can continue to improve. To drive accountability, we linked a portion of our executive and employee compensation to diversity and inclusion metrics in 2024.In 2024, women represented 27.9% of our global employees, 18.3% of our senior leadership positions2, and 25.3% of our technical positions. Underrepresented minorities3, including Black/African American employees, Hispanic, and Native American employees, represented 17.8% of our US employees and 8.7% of our US senior leadership positions.1 Undesired turnover includes all regular Intel employees who voluntarily left Intel, but does not include Intel contract employees, interns, or employees who separated from Intel due to divestiture, retirement, voluntary separation packages, death, job elimination, or redeployment, or Mobileye and other non-integrated subsidiaries employees.2 Senior leadership is defined as salary grades 10+ or equivalent grades. Population includes all regular Intel employees but does not include Mobileye and  other non-integrated subsidiaries employees.3 Underrepresented minority population includes all regular Intel employees but does not include Mobileye and other non-integrated subsidiaries employees. Our Capital10Compensation and BenefitsWe structure pay, benefits, and services to meet the varying needs of our employees, helping support employee financial well-being with competitive compensation, investment opportunities, and financial resources. Our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave, parent reintegration, family expansion assistance, flexible work schedules, sabbaticals, and on-site services. Since 2019, we have achieved gender pay equity globally and we continue to maintain race/ethnicity pay equity in the US. We achieve pay equity by closing the gap in average pay between employees of different genders or race/ethnicity in the same or similar roles after accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences, such as location, time at grade level, and tenure. We have also advanced transparency in our pay and representation data by publicly releasing our EEO-1 survey pay data since 2019. We believe that our holistic approach toward pay equity, representation, and creating an inclusive culture enables us to cultivate a workplace that helps employees develop and progress in their careers at all levels. Our \"hybrid-first\" approach to working was informed by employees surveyed around the globe and involves the majority of our employees splitting their time between working remotely and in the office. Hybrid-first and remote work options cast a wider recruitment net and support our ambition to hire the best global talent. Currently, there is no company-wide mandate on the number of days per week employees should be on site or how they should collaborate. Our goal is to enable remote and on-site work where it drives the best output, while providing our employees with equitable access to systems, resources, and opportunities that allow them to succeed.Health, Safety, and WellnessWe are committed to providing a safe and injury-free workplace. We regularly invest in programs designed to improve physical, mental, and social well-being. We provide access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs, including on-site health centers, and we aim to increase awareness of and support for mental and behavioral health. We intend to continue our efforts to build our strong safety culture and drive the global expansion of our corporate wellness program through employee education and engagement activities.Social and Relationship CapitalWe are committed to engaging in initiatives that support our communities and help us develop trusted relationships with our stakeholders. Proactive engagement with our stakeholders and investments in social impact initiatives, including those aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, advance our position as a leading corporate citizen and create shared value for Intel, our global supply chain, and our communities.Economic and social. The health of our business and local economies depends in part on continued investments in innovation. We provide high-skill, high-paying jobs around the world, many of which are manufacturing and R&D jobs located in our factories. As we expand operations in both existing and new locations, we are building a pipeline of qualified workers through our talent strategy and the many investments we are making in education. We also benefit economies through our R&D ecosystem spending, sourcing activities, employee spending, and tax payments.Human rights commitment. We are committed to maintaining and improving systems and processes to avoid causing or contributing to adverse impacts on human rights in our operations, products, and supply chain. We have established an integrated approach to managing human rights across our business, including senior-level management involvement and board-level oversight. We also meet throughout the year with external stakeholders and experts on human rights to continue to inform and evolve our human rights policies and oversight processes. While we do not always know nor can we control what products our customers create or the applications end users may develop, we do not support or tolerate our products being used to adversely impact human rights. Where we become aware of a concern that Intel products are being used by a business partner in connection with abuses of human rights, we intend to evaluate and restrict or cease business with the third party unless and until we have high confidence that Intel's products are not being used to adversely impact human rights.Supply Chain ResponsibilityWe actively manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve overall performance and value creation for Intel, our customers, and our suppliers. To drive responsible and sustainable practices throughout our supply chain, we have robust programs to educate and engage suppliers that support our global manufacturing operations. We actively collaborate with other companies and lead industry initiatives on key issues such as improving transparency around climate and water impacts in the global electronics supply chain, and we are advancing collaboration across our industry on responsible minerals sourcing. Through these efforts, we help set electronics industry-wide standards, develop audit processes, and conduct training.Over the past decade, we have directly engaged with suppliers to verify compliance and build operational capacity to address risks of forced and bonded labor and other human rights issues. We perform periodic audits and identify critical direct suppliers to engage through capability-building programs, which help suppliers build sustainability acumen and verify compliance with the Responsible Business Alliance and the Intel Code of Conduct. We also engage with indirect suppliers through our programs on forced and bonded labor, responsible minerals, and supplier diversity.  Our Capital11Natural CapitalReducing our environmental footprint as we grow helps us create efficiencies, support our communities, and respond to the needs of our stakeholders. We invest in environmental projects and set company-wide environmental goals to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water use, and waste to landfills. We build energy efficiency into our products to help our customers lower their own emissions, energy usage, and costs, and we collaborate with policymakers and other stakeholders to use technology to address environmental challenges. We continue to take action on emissions reduction strategies focused on emissions abatement, and to make additional investments in renewable electricity, process and equipment optimization, and energy conservation. In 2024, we linked a portion of the executive and employee performance bonus to our goal to reduce our 2024 Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, compared to 2023. We also focus on addressing climate change impacts upstream and downstream in the value chain. This includes improving product energy efficiency and increasing the positive impact of our products by leveraging opportunities for Intel technologies to enable other sectors of the economy to reduce their climate and energy footprints.EnergyWe focus on reducing our own climate change impact, and over the past two decades have reduced our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy consumption and invested in renewable electricity and on-site alternative energy projects. In 2024, continuing our practice of linking a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our corporate sustainability metrics, we linked a portion of the performance bonus to our 2024 target to reach 95% renewable electricity use globally. Water StewardshipWater is essential to the semiconductor manufacturing process. We use ultrapure water to remove impurities from our silicon wafers, and we use fresh and reclaimed water to run our manufacturing facility systems. Our water strategy illustrates our commitment to manage water resources efficiently. In 2024, we linked a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our target to conserve and restore 13.5 billion gallons of water during the year.Circular Economy and Waste ManagementWe have long been committed to waste management, recycling, and circular economy strategies that enable the recovery and productive re-use of waste streams. We continue to focus on opportunities to upcycle waste by improving waste segregation practices and collaborating with our suppliers to evaluate new technologies for waste recovery. In 2024, we linked a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our interim target to achieve a greater than 90% recycling rate of construction waste.Governance and DisclosureWe are committed to transparency around our carbon footprint and climate risk, and use the framework developed by the TCFD to inform our disclosure on climate governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. For governance and strategy, we follow an integrated approach to address climate change, with multiple teams responsible for managing climate-related activities, initiatives, and policies, with senior-level management involvement and board-level oversight, including the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. We describe our overall risk management processes in our proxy statement, and describe climate-related risks and opportunities in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, the Intel Climate Change Policy, the Intel Climate Transition Action Plan, and \"Risk Factors\" within this Form 10-K.

Our customers primarily include OEMs, ODMs, cloud service providers, and other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. We market and sell these products directly through our global sales and marketing organizations and indirectly through channel partners. We manufacture our products at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities located throughout the world. We seek to expand our Intel Foundry business as a third-party foundry for external customers. A Year in Review2024 revenue was $53.1 billion, down $1.1 billion, or 2%, from 2023 due to lower all other revenue and lower Intel Foundry revenue, partially offset by higher Intel Products revenue. All other revenue decreased 32% from 2023, driven by lower Altera revenue due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories across all product lines and lower Mobileye revenue as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories of EyeQ products. Intel Foundry external revenue decreased 60% from 2023 due to lower traditional packaging services and lower equipment sales. Intel Products revenue increased 3% from 2023 due primarily to higher CCG and DCAI revenue. CCG revenue increased 4% from 2023 primarily due to higher notebook volume compared to 2023 and was partially offset by lower other CCG revenue, which decreased from 2023 due to the exit of legacy businesses, and lower desktop revenue, which decreased on lower demand compared to 2023. DCAI revenue increased 1% from 2023 driven by higher server revenue primarily from high core count products, which increased ASPs and lowered volume compared to 2023.Our consolidated results of operations in 2024 were meaningfully impacted by non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, restructuring charges resulting from our 2024 Restructuring Plan, non-cash impairments of goodwill and certain other assets, as well as non-cash charges related to a valuation allowance recognized against our US deferred tax assets. In 2024, we invested $16.5 billion in R&D, made gross capital investments of $25.1 billion, and had $8.3 billion in cash from operations and negative $2.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow1.Our 2024 results reflect the continued advancement of our transformational journey. In 2024, our previously announced internal foundry operating model took effect, creating a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCAI, and NEX) and the Intel Foundry business (including Foundry Technology Development, Foundry Manufacturing and Supply Chain, and Foundry Services, formerly IFS). The foundry operating model is designed to reshape operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. In furtherance of our internal foundry operating model, we began separately reporting the financials for our Intel Products and Intel Foundry businesses in Q1 2024 and, in Q3 2024, we announced our intent to establish Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. We also made meaningful progress on our previously announced plan to operate Altera® as a standalone business beginning in Q1 2024, readying the business and paving the way for value capture opportunities in early 2025. RestructuringIn 2024, we announced our intention to implement a series of cost and capital reduction initiatives designed to adjust our spending to current business trends while enabling our new operating model and continuing to fund investments in our core strategy—returning to product and process competitiveness. These initiatives, which we refer to as our 2024 Restructuring Plan, include reducing headcount, consolidating and reducing our global real estate footprint, conducting portfolio reviews of our businesses under a \"clean sheet\" view, rationalizing capital investments and deployments based upon demand signals and capacity requirements, and reducing our overall operating expenses. The headcount actions in connection with the 2024 Restructuring Plan are expected to result in an approximate 15% decrease in our core Intel workforce by early 2025. As a result of initiating and deploying our 2024 Restructuring Plan, we recognized restructuring charges of $2.8 billion in 2024.Our 2024 consolidated results of operations were also materially impacted by the following:■$3.3 billion of charges, substantially all of which were recorded to cost of sales, related to non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to our Intel 7 process node;■$3.1 billion of non-cash charges associated with the impairment of goodwill for certain of our reporting units as well as certain acquired intangible assets (see \"Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and■$9.9 billion of non-cash charges recorded to provision for income taxes that substantially related to valuation allowances recorded to our net deferred tax assets (see \"Note 8: Income Taxes\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).Segments and Prior Year ResultsDuring 2024, we managed our business through the operating segments that are presented below and have included the 2024, 2023, and 2022 segment financial results and related discussions of our segments' results of operations. Our segments' results of operations presented below exclude the $7.0 billion of restructuring and other charges and $9.9 billion of charges resulting from valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets, in addition to certain other items, as our CODMs receive, view, and use information for decision-making purposes based upon segment results that exclude such items.MD&A13We have also included the 2024, 2023, and 2022 consolidated financial results and related discussions of our consolidated results of operations for 2024 relative to 2023 subsequent to the operating segment discussion below.

As the stewards of Moore's Law, we aim to continue to innovate and advance world-class silicon process and advanced packaging technologies. Our foundry offerings benefit from several key advantages: our robust design ecosystem with key industry partners; our systems of chips capabilities; and our secure, resilient, and sustainable supply chain. Our foundry is built on the foundation of our silicon process and advanced packaging technology offerings and enables co-optimized solutions for the AI era. We are strengthening the resilience of the global semiconductor supply chain for leading-edge and mature node semiconductor products by investing in geographically balanced and more sustainable manufacturing capacity. As a foundry for the AI era, Intel Foundry brings together these critical components to help drive the next phase of technology innovation.Market Trends and StrategyAI is driving transformational changes in the global market for semiconductors. AI demands an ever-increasing amount of computation performance and an ever-increasing need for power efficiency. To deliver the step function changes in performant yet efficient and cost-effective systems required to enable AI, a generational shift in computer architectures is underway, built on smaller, more efficient and performant transistors. Architectures are shifting from general monolithic silicon chips to systems of interconnected chiplets optimized for specific workloads and market segments, requiring more advanced packaging technologies to stitch together these increasingly complex designs. The global semiconductor industry and our customers are changing the way they build chips and systems while simultaneously redesigning their supply chains to be more resilient and sustainable.Over time, the capital intensity of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing has grown meaningfully and forced most manufacturers to give up the pursuit of Moore’s Law as they lacked sufficient scale to drive a positive return on investments in the next-generation process technology. Currently, we believe we are only one of three manufacturers pursuing 2nm lithography. Leading-edge foundries seek to amortize their leading-edge investments over many years. In early years, they seek to maximize volume and pricing on leading-edge designs that benefit from the most performant transistors. In later years, when the once advanced process technology becomes a mature technology, ease of design and manufacturing cost become more paramount.Our strategy builds on our history of developing leading-edge semiconductor technologies for our products. While we expect our manufacturing facilities to continue to mostly produce our own products for many years to come, we are aiming to become a major provider of semiconductor manufacturing solutions for third parties as well. As we pursue that strategy, the volume from our own products helps provide the significant scale required for leading-edge foundry operations and helps derisk our foundry offerings for our third-party customers. The addition of third-party customers would, on the leading edge, help provide further scale to support our foundry operations and, for process nodes that are mature, enable better monetization of our technology and manufacturing facility investments. We plan to create greater independence for our foundry operations by establishing Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. We expect this to provide Intel Foundry with clearer separation and independence for foundry customers and suppliers and increase our flexibility to evaluate separate sources of funding and capital structures for our foundry and product businesses.Products, Services, and CompetitionIntel Foundry combines technology, manufacturing, supply chain, and systems capabilities to enable systems to be optimized for their workloads while providing resilience and sustainability in the supply chain. Intel Foundry aims to deliver leading-edge process technology and to build out offerings of mature process nodes for third parties. Our factory network provides geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. Intel Foundry enables Intel Products and external customers to benefit from our advanced technologies, systems capabilities, and manufacturing network, and we expect to achieve volume production of products on our 2nm node, Intel 18A, in 2025. We seek to address the transformational shift in the semiconductor industry being driven by AI and the demand for ever-increasing computation power by providing leading foundry capabilities to support Intel Products and external customers, delivered from a resilient, secure, and more sustainable supply chain. Intel Foundry's offerings are foundational and consist of advanced process technologies enabled by an ecosystem of electronic design automation tools, intellectual property, and design services from vendors used by our external customers. This ecosystem enables external customers to design with Intel technologies as they would with other foundries. The systems of chips capabilities include architecture, advanced packaging technologies, software, and services to accelerate time to market, and driving standards to improve system performance and power consumption.MD&A19Table of ContentsIntel Foundry's process technologies available to external customers are expected to include our upcoming Intel 18A process featuring RibbonFET (gate-all-around) and PowerVia (back-side power delivery) as expected industry firsts; our new Intel 3 process using EUV lithography; our established Intel 7 and Intel 16 process technologies; and a new 12nm foundry process technology we are developing in collaboration with United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC). We announced an extension to our leading-edge roadmap beyond Intel 18A with the introduction of Intel 14A. Intel Foundry's advanced semiconductor assembly and test offerings include families of advanced technologies for packaging single chips or combining multiple chips together in a package, adjacent to each other, stacked on top of each other, or through a combination thereof. In addition to our core packaging technologies, we have differentiated capabilities to design and produce complex packaged parts with optimal performance, power, and cost at high yield. We continue to drive the technologies, capabilities, and standards needed to optimize systems of chips, including the Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express* standard for communication between chips in a system, which we demonstrated in silicon in 2023. We aim to accelerate our customers' designs by providing advanced technologies, services, and systems software that leverage Intel's deep knowledge as a systems company.The competitors to Intel Foundry are primarily semiconductor foundries that focus on delivering wafers and packaging technologies from fabrication plants based primarily in Asia, and include TSMC, Samsung, Global Foundries, UMC, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). We compete with TSMC and Samsung in the advanced process technology marketplace.Intel Foundry Financial Performance1Years Ended ($ In Millions)Dec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Revenue$17,543 $18,910 $27,491 Cost of sales25,596 21,471 28,052 Gross loss(8,053)(2,561)(561)Operating expenses5,355 4,394 4,608 Operating loss$(13,408)$(6,955)$(5,169)Gross loss %(46)%(14)%(2)%Operating loss %(76)%(37)%(19)%1 Operating segment results include intersegment financial activity; refer to \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" for a reconciliation between our operating segment and consolidated financial results for the periods presented.Operating Segment Revenue Summary2024 vs. 2023Revenue was $17.5 billion, down $1.4 billion from 2023.

All other revenue decreased 32% from 2023, driven by lower Altera revenue due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories across all product lines and lower Mobileye revenue as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories of EyeQ products. Intel Foundry external revenue decreased 60% from 2023 due to lower traditional packaging services and lower equipment sales. Intel Products revenue increased 3% from 2023 due primarily to higher CCG and DCAI revenue. CCG revenue increased 4% from 2023 primarily due to higher notebook volume compared to 2023 and was partially offset by lower other CCG revenue, which decreased from 2023 due to the exit of legacy businesses, and lower desktop revenue, which decreased on lower demand compared to 2023. DCAI revenue increased 1% from 2023 driven by higher server revenue primarily from high core count products, which increased ASPs and lowered volume compared to 2023.1 Excludes intersegment revenue; totals may not sum due to roundingMD&A23Table of ContentsConsolidated Gross MarginWe derived a majority of our consolidated gross margin in 2024, and 2023 from our Intel Products business sales through our CCG, DCAI, and NEX operating segments.Gross Margin $B(Percentages in chart indicate gross margin as a percentage of total revenue) 2024 vs. 2023Our consolidated gross margin in 2024 decreased by $4.4 billion, or 20%, compared to 2023 due primarily to higher 2024 impairment charges and accelerated depreciation. During Q3 2024, we concluded that our manufacturing asset portfolio, primarily for our Intel 7 process node, exceeded manufacturing capacity requirements. Upon completing an asset re-use assessment, we impaired certain construction-in-progress assets and accelerated depreciation for certain in-use manufacturing assets that resulted in $3.3 billion of charges in 2024. Our 2024 gross margin also decreased due to lower revenue, higher unit cost primarily from an increased mix of Intel 4 and Intel 7 products, higher period charges due to $922 million in Gaudi AI accelerator inventory-related charges recognized in 2024, and higher factory start-up costs. These 2024 unfavorable gross margin impacts were partially offset by certain favorable gross margin movements in 2024, including lower period charges driven by the sell-through of previously reserved inventory and lower non-accelerator reserves taken, lower period charges related to excess capacity charges, and a benefit recognized for government incentives received under the CHIPS Act.We are making capital investments in furtherance of our strategy. As of December 28, 2024, our capital investments classified as construction in progress totaled $50.4 billion ($43.4 billion as of December 30, 2023). These assets have not yet been placed into service and have not yet begun depreciating. As these construction-in-progress assets are placed into service, we expect to incur depreciation expense that impacts future production costs and, ultimately, cost of sales. To the extent we are unable to grow our revenues to offset these production costs, our gross margin and operating income will be unfavorably affected. Additionally, we could incur asset impairments on property, plant, and equipment assets if our strategy is not successful.MD&A24Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesTotal R&D and MG&A expenses for 2024 were $22.1 billion, up 2% compared to 2023. These expenses represent 41.5% of revenue for 2024 and 40.0% of revenue for 2023. In support of our strategy, we continue to make significant investments to accelerate our process technology roadmap. As a result of our 2024 Restructuring Plan and related cost-reduction measures, we expect a decrease in total R&D and MG&A expenses in future periods as we focus investments in R&D and create capacity for sustained investment in technology and manufacturing.Research and Development $BMarketing, General, and Administrative $B(Percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of total revenue) Research and Development2024 vs. 2023R&D increased by $500 million, or 3%, primarily driven by investments in our process technology and products, and higher share-based compensation, partially offset by lower incentive-based compensation and the effects of various cost-reduction measures.Marketing, General, and Administrative2024 vs. 2023MG&A decreased by $127 million, or 2%, primarily driven by lower incentive-based compensation, share-based compensation, and the effects of various cost-reduction measures, partially offset by higher corporate spending to drive business transformation.

We expect that our 2024 Restructuring Plan, in conjunction with other initiatives, will reduce our cost structure while we continue our investments to develop, manufacture, market, sell, and deliver product and process initiatives in furtherance of our strategy. We expect actions pursuant to the 2024 Restructuring Plan to be substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2025, which is subject to change. Any changes to the estimates or timing will be reflected in our results of operations.Employee severance and benefit arrangements includes net charges relating to the 2024 Restructuring Plan of $2.2 billion in 2024. Charges relating to other actions taken to streamline operations and to reduce costs were $294 million in 2024. The charges in 2023 and 2022 primarily related to the 2022 Restructuring Program, which was approved to rebalance our workforce and operations in alignment with our strategy and was completed in Q1 2024. The 2022 Restructuring Program, in conjunction with other initiatives, reduced our cost structure and allowed us to reinvest certain of these cost savings in resources and capacity to develop, manufacture, market, sell, and deliver our products in furtherance of our strategy.Litigation charges and other includes a charge of $780 million that we recorded in 2024 arising out of the R2 litigation. In 2023, a $1.2 billion benefit was recorded due to the reduction in the previously accrued charge as a result of developments in the VLSI litigation. 2023 charges also included a $401 million charge for an EC-imposed fine and a $353 million termination fee in connection with our inability to timely obtain required regulatory approvals needed to acquire Tower Semiconductor Ltd. Refer to \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about litigation related items. Asset impairment charges in 2024 includes non-cash charges associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan, including $442 million of non-cash impairments of construction-in-progress assets associated with our decision to exit and outsource manufacturing capabilities for certain internal test hardware; and $103 million of non-cash impairments of operating leased assets and related leasehold improvements resulting from real estate consolidations and exits. Real estate consolidations and exits did not significantly change our operating lease liabilities and may result in future cash outlays for facility restoration or the relocation of operations. In addition, we incurred non-cash impairments relating to goodwill and acquired intangible assets of $3.1 billion in 2024. Refer to \"Note 11: Goodwill\" and \"Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about these items.MD&A26Table of ContentsGains (Losses) on Equity Investments and Interest and Other, NetYears Ended (In Millions)Dec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Unrealized gains (losses) on marketable equity investments$(218)$(99)$(829)Unrealized gains (losses) on non-marketable equity investments192 17 299 Impairment charges(347)(214)(190)Unrealized gains (losses) on equity investments, net(473)(296)(720)Realized gains (losses) on sales of equity investments, net715 336 4,988 Gains (losses) on equity investments, net242 40 4,268 Interest and other, net$226 $629 $1,166 1    Unrealized gains (losses) on non-marketable investments includes observable price adjustments and our share of equity method investee gains (losses) and certain distributions.Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments, Net In 2024, we recognized net gains on equity investments of $242 million primarily due to $460 million of net gains related to our marketable equity investment portfolio, the majority of which related to the sale of our interest in Astera Labs and is within realized gains (losses) on sales of equity investments, net.In 2023, we recognized net gains on equity investments of $40 million primarily due to $213 million of net gains related to our marketable equity investment portfolio, substantially all of which is within realized gains (losses) on sales of equity investments, net.Interest and Other, NetIn 2024, interest and other, net decreased primarily due to higher interest expense due to higher 2024 average borrowings and lower other, net. Included in other, net in 2024 is a loss of $755 million from the change in fair value of a non-designated derivative related to our assessed probability of paying construction-related liquidated damages to Apollo, our Ireland SCIP partner. In 2024, we also received and recognized $560 million as a benefit to other, net for interest in relation to the European Commission competition matter for which we recorded and paid a ruling amount to the European Commission in 2009 and that we were successful at challenging and overturning with the ruling amount refunded to us in 2022.Provision for (Benefit from) TaxesYears Ended ($ In Millions)Dec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Income (loss) before taxes$(11,210)$762 $7,768 Provision for (benefit from) taxes$8,023 $(913)$(249)Effective tax rate71.6 %(119.8)%(3.2)%Our effective tax rate increased in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by the effects associated with the establishment of a valuation allowance against our US federal deferred tax assets in 2024. We assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets quarterly, weighing available positive and negative evidence. As a result of our assessment in the third quarter of 2024, we determined it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recoverable based upon our three-year cumulative historical loss position as of the third quarter of 2024, largely resulting from the asset impairment and restructuring and other charges incurred during the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, our 2024 provision for taxes and 2023 benefit from taxes included R&D tax credits, which provide a tax benefit based on our eligible R&D spending and are not dependent on lower income before taxes.MD&A27Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesWe believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, and total cash and short-term investments as shown in the table below, are our primary sources of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. These sources are further supplemented by our committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity and certain other Smart Capital initiatives that we have undertaken, including our Ireland SCIP transaction that closed in the second quarter of 2024 that resulted in $11.0 billion of net cash inflows to us (see \"Note 4: Non-Controlling Interests\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; investments in our product roadmap; working capital requirements, including cash outlays associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan; partner distributions to our non-controlling interest holders; and strategic investments. We expect reductions in operating expenditures, capital expenditures, and cost of sales after implementing our 2024 Restructuring Plan and related cost-reduction measures, including reductions in headcount, which are designed to enable further operational efficiency and agility and create capacity for sustained investment in technology and manufacturing competitiveness. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology. These plans include expanding existing operations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, and investing in a new leading-edge manufacturing facility in Ohio. They may also include longer-term projects, certain of which we have currently put on hold or slowed the completion of, including a new leading-edge manufacturing facility, a new assembly and test facility, and a new advanced packaging facility, among others. We entered into government incentive arrangements with the US federal government pursuant to the CHIPS Act. In September 2024, we were awarded up to $3.0 billion in direct funding for the Secure Enclave program to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the US government. In November 2024, we signed a Direct Funding Agreement with the US Department of Commerce for the award of $7.9 billion in government incentives pursuant to the CHIPS Act, and we received $1.1 billion of cash in 2024 and have received an additional $1.1 billion of cash in 2025. We expect to continue to benefit from government incentives, though recent US government actions create uncertainty as to the receipt of awards under our existing CHIPS Act agreements and the potential for future awards in the US. These incentives typically require that we make significant capital investments in new facilities or expand existing facilities and our related workforce. To the extent we delay or cancel any such projects or otherwise are unable or fail to comply with the terms of the agreements, there may be a delay in our receipt of, or we may forfeit or be required to repay, the associated government incentives.We expect to adjust the cadence of our investments based on the execution of our roadmap and changing business conditions. As of December 28, 2024, we had commitments for capital expenditures of $14.0 billion for 2025 and had $6.0 billion in capital expenditures committed in the long term. As of December 28, 2024, other purchase obligations and commitments in 2025 under our binding commitments for purchases of goods and services were $2.1 billion, with an additional $4.9 billion committed in the long term.We have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures and other purchase obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. For example, see: \"Note 4: Non-Controlling Interests\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our SCIP arrangements and variable distribution payments that we expect to make to our co-investment partners, including liquidated damage provisions should we fail to meet certain construction milestones or operational metrics; \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our lease obligations, which include supply agreements structured as leases; \"Note 8: Income Taxes\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our tax obligations, including impacts from Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings; and \"Note 13: Borrowings\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our debt obligations. The expected timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition, some of our purchasing requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included in the amounts above. For example, some of these requirements are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by vendors on a purchase order basis within short time horizons.When assessing our current sources of liquidity, we include our total cash and short-term investments as follows: (In Millions)Dec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Cash and cash equivalents$8,249 $7,079 Short-term investments13,813 17,955 Total cash and short-term investments$22,062 $25,034 Total debt$50,011 $49,266 We suspended the declaration of quarterly dividends starting with Q4 2024. We are prohibited under our commercial CHIPS Act agreement from paying dividends for the next two years and are subject to limitations on the payment of dividends for the three years thereafter. Further, we do not expect to pay dividends until our cash flows improve as we focus on the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy and create long-term value.MD&A28Table of ContentsDuring 2024, we issued a total of $2.6 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and remarketed $438 million aggregate principal amount of other bonds for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures. During 2024, we also expanded both our 5-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility agreement and our 364-day $5.0 billion credit facility agreement, to $7.0 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, and the maturity dates were extended to February 2029 and January 2025, respectively. In January 2025, we amended our 364-day $8.0 billion credit facility agreement to $5.0 billion, and the maturity date was extended by one year to January 2026. We have other potential sources of liquidity, including our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of December 28, 2024, we had no commercial paper obligations outstanding and no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities. See \"Note 13: Borrowings\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Our total cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity, among other factors, for our strategic business requirements. In 2024, these actions included, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the amounts and timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. While such actions have benefited, and may further benefit, cash flow in the near term, we may experience a corresponding detriment to cash flow in future periods as these actions cease or as the impacts of these actions reverse or normalize. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments were in investment-grade securities in 2024. Cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities$8,288 $11,471 $15,433 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities(18,256)(24,041)(10,231)Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities11,138 8,505 1,115 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$1,170 $(4,065)$6,317 Operating ActivitiesOperating cash flows consist of net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.Cash provided by operations in 2024 was lower compared to 2023 by $3.2 billion as we incurred a net loss in 2024 that was fully offset by a higher amount of favorable operating cash flow adjustments for non-cash items like depreciation, share-based compensation, and restructuring and other expenses, compared to net income in 2023 with lower favorable operating cash flow adjustments.Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; proceeds from capital-related government incentives; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. Our investing capital expenditures were $23.9 billion in 2024 ($25.8 billion in 2023 and $24.8 billion in 2022). The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to lower purchases of short-term investments, lower capital expenditures, higher proceeds from capital-related government incentives, and higher sales of equity investments. These 2024 cash favorable activities were partially offset by lower maturities and sales of short-term investments and higher 2024 cash used in other investing activities.Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from strategic initiatives, including partner contributions and equity-related issuances, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, financing for capital expenditures with non-standard payment terms, and payment of dividends to stockholders.The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher SCIP partner contributions, reduced dividend payments, and other cash favorable financing activities in 2024. These 2024 cash favorable financing activities were partially offset by lower proceeds from debt issuances, net of repayments; the absence of proceeds from sales of subsidiary shares; and higher financing for capital expenditures with non-standard payment terms in 2024.MD&A29Table of ContentsCritical Accounting EstimatesThe methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) we must make assumptions that are uncertain when the judgment is made, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our Consolidated Financial Statements. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was made.Refer to \"Note 2: Accounting Policies\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates, which are as follows, as well as our significant accounting policies:▪Inventories—the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory, net of factory excess capacity charges. Inventory reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering forecasted future demand and market conditions; ▪Long-lived assets—the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment and evaluation of useful lives of property, plant, and equipment; identified intangibles; and impairment of goodwill, including the determination of asset groupings and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units; and▪Loss contingencies—the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document references adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings and provides an additional means to evaluate the cash flow trends of our business. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow adjusted for (1) additions to property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from capital-related government incentives and net partner contributions, (2) payments on finance leases, and (3) proceeds from the McAfee equity sale in 2022. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.Following is the reconciliation of our most comparable US GAAP measure to our non-GAAP measure presented:Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities$8,288 $11,471 $15,433 $29,456 $35,864 Net purchase of property, plant, and equipment(10,515)(23,228)(23,724)(18,567)(14,086)Payments on finance leases(1)(96)(345)— — Sale of equity investment— — 4,561 — — Adjusted free cash flow$(2,228)$(11,853)$(4,075)$10,889 $21,778 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities$(18,256)$(24,041)$(10,231)$(24,283)$(21,351)Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities$11,138 $8,505 $1,115 $(6,211)$(12,842)MD&A30Table of ContentsRisk Factors and Other Key InformationRisk FactorsThe following summarizes the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. When any one or more of the following risks materialize from time to time, our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations can be materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations can also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations, or by various risks that are generally applicable to most companies. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Some of the factors, events, and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, and the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events, or contingencies have occurred in the past, but are provided because future occurrences of such factors, events, or contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our business. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including in the MD&A and Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.We are in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry.The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological, geopolitical, and market developments; changes in industry standards; changes in customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent product introductions and improvements. When we do not anticipate or respond to these developments, our competitive position can weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has intensified in recent years, and we expect it to continue to do so in the future, including as a result of the proliferation of AI and high demand for AI-related products and services. If we are not able to compete effectively, or if our foundry strategy is unsuccessful, our financial results will be adversely affected, including through reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.We face intense competition across our product portfolio. Our competitors include companies offering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; accelerator products such as GPUs, including those offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity and networking products; and other semiconductor products. Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms, such as the ARM architecture, and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. For example, ARM-based products and the ARM ecosystem have seen increased development and adoption in recent years. We also compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers. Some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads. For example, in 2020, Apple introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in place of our client CPUs, and we face increasing competition from Apple's products and ecosystem.Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as TSMC or Samsung, for the manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products. Manufacturing process and assembly and test improvements introduced by such foundries have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to increasingly competitive offerings by our competitors. Our process technology roadmap to regain transistor performance and power performance competitiveness is subject to a number of risks, and we could fail to realize our goals, including due to changes in competitor technology roadmaps, changes affecting our projections regarding our technology or competing technology, and the risks described in the risk factor \"The development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and uncertainties.\" As an integrated device manufacturer, we have higher capital expenditures and R&D spending than many of our fabless competitors due to the high ongoing investments required to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity. We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or business collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which could have a significant impact on our competitive position. For example, we could face increased competition as a result of China's programs to promote a domestic semiconductor industry and supply chains.Our products compete based on a number of factors, including performance, energy efficiency, ease-of-integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by product and market segment. To the extent our products do not meet our customers' requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape, our business and results of operations can be harmed. For example, we have lost market share in recent years as competitors have introduced highly competitive data center and client platform products. Our data center business has been further negatively impacted by the shift of customer spend toward GPUs in the past few years. Additionally, to the extent we rely upon third party foundries for our products, our margins may be negatively impacted, as has been the case with the Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors launched in September 2024.We have limited experience in the highly competitive and capital-intensive third-party foundry business. As we pursue our strategy to establish Intel Foundry as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, we will face intense competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC, Samsung, Global Foundries (GF), United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). To succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; multi-chip packaging; system integration; manufacturing capacity; price; margin; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Building and maintaining a competitive foundry business requires significant Risk Factors and Other Key Information31Table of Contentsongoing investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances must be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped. As we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, Malaysia, and Israel, and we may have additional project delays or project cancellations in the future. Moreover, many of the largest potential foundry customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose products compete with our own. As a result, our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality information, intellectual property, and foundry capacity, among other competitive concerns, to attract and retain such customers. Our limited third-party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain talented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading-edge and legacy nodes. Our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of, regulatory and environmental restrictions imposed upon, and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm. These significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly uncertain. We are making significant, long-term and inherently risky investments in R&D and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a favorable return.To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, improve our products and processes, and make significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities, all ahead of competitors and market demand. The R&D efforts and capital investments we require are intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies and we may not have the ability to fund such investments at the level needed to be competitive. We incurred R&D expenses of $16.5 billion in 2024, $16.0 billion in 2023 and $17.5 billion in 2022. We are focusing our R&D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, AI, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, in four years and our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. Our investments are typically long-term and, even where successful, often do not contribute to our operating results for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate, including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. In such instances where we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, transistor density, die utilization, core counts, and/or new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we have faced and will face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages relative to our competitors. This has in the past and may in the future result in higher operating costs, including as a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity, higher leverage and borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of Intel's 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor would be delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utilization of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.The investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital expenditures above our historical levels. In recent years, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utilizing leading process technologies, including as a result of the use of EUV and high-NA EUV lithography tools. Our ownership and operation of such high-tech fabrication facilities, and our need to build new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand, has resulted and will continue to result in us incurring large capital outlays and high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. Such capital outlays and costs include those related to utilization of existing facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are expected to deliver, or if demand for our products, foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and other unfavorable market factors. As we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, Malaysia, and Israel. We could also be required to write off inventory or record excess manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. For example, in the third quarter of 2024 we recorded $3.1 billion of charges related to non-cash impairments and the accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to the Intel 7 process node.Risk Factors and Other Key Information32Table of ContentsThe development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and uncertainties.We are continually engaged in the development of next-generation technologies. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes and other technologies is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials or new production equipment, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes, and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially anticipated. We are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology, and in 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our 7nm process technology that resulted in delays relative to our prior expectations. In 2022, Intel's 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor was delayed to allow for more platform and product validation time. These delays have allowed competitors using third-party foundries, such as TSMC, to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us, including improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which have helped increase the competitiveness of their products. On the product side, we have had limited market success with our accelerator offerings, and in 2024 we recognized $922 million in Gaudi AI accelerator inventory-related charges. We may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of further delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products or lack of market success with our offerings. Our efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process and packaging technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost, performance, power, and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&D investments, particularly as the development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses, as we were required to do in the third quarter of 2024 with respect to the Intel 7 process node.Risks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, failure to achieve expected performance, power, and area improvements, and product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications). Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs, adversely affect our gross margins, and contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. A new process node typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields, and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes. In addition, the cost of new leading-edge process nodes continues to increase at a higher rate relative to legacy process nodes due to a number of factors, including the cost of procuring and operating advanced manufacturing equipment. As the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have increased the number of transistors per die, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields that may also increase our costs to manufacture and warranty our products.Our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase.From time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors; defects in materials; delays in obtaining or revising permits and licenses; interruptions in our supply of materials, resources, or production equipment; adverse changes in equipment productivity; and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields and could result in production timing delays. Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations.Risk Factors and Other Key Information33Table of ContentsOur implementation of new business strategies and investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed.Our implementation of new business strategies, including our foundry strategy and our cost reduction measures, as well as our many internal structural, systems, and process changes, may subject us to a number of risks. We have entered new businesses and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by growth in semiconductor demand, ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. As part of our strategy, we announced plans to establish Intel Foundry as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others and to implement an internal foundry operating model through updates to our processes, systems, and guardrails between our manufacturing and our individual product-based business units. The implementation of our internal foundry operating model requires many internal structural, system, and process changes to support the separation of the product and manufacturing sides of our business and our external foundry business, including a new enterprise resource planning system. In parallel, we are undertaking significant efforts to separate out portions of our business, such as operating Intel Foundry, Altera and IMS, as autonomous subsidiaries that we majority own and consolidate in order to potentially raise capital and unlock value as we focus on our core product and manufacturing capabilities. Significant business changes are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2022, we wound down Intel Optane; in 2020, we agreed to sell our NAND memory business to SK hynix; and in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for those businesses. These new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition in not just new and evolving markets but also in our existing markets. These new sources of competition can include established competitors with well-developed and highly competitive technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices, margins, or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. We may also not be successful in developing a competitive foundry business for external customers with respect to either leading-edge or mature process nodes, which would make it difficult for us to realize a favorable return on our investments in process technology and manufacturing capacity investments. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs. Our Smart Capital approach to capital spending, alternative financing arrangements, and pursuit of government grants involves risks and may not be successful.As we pursue our strategy, we have utilized our Smart Capital approach to capital spending in an effort to appropriately time and scale our capital investments. To support our capital investments, we have pursued alternative financing arrangements, such as our 2022 joint investment with Brookfield in the manufacturing expansion of our Arizona campus, and our 2024 joint investment with Apollo related to Fab 34 in Ireland, and may enter into similar arrangements in the future. These transactions may fail to advance our business strategy, may include unfavorable pricing or other terms such as penalties should key metrics not be attained as prescribed by our agreements, and may fail to achieve their anticipated benefits. Both arrangements include commitments we may not be able to satisfy, including commitments relating to construction and/or wafer demand or purchase, in which case we may be required to make additional payments to our partners. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized a $755 million charge related to penalties we expect to pay in connection with Ireland SCIP for construction delays we decided to make as we reduced our near-term capacity requirements. Further, both arrangements are expected to significantly and increasingly impact our net income (loss) attributable to Intel and earnings (loss) per share attributable to Intel in future periods as wafer production volumes increase at our expanded Arizona campus and at Fab 34 in Ireland. Our partners may also fail to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely and we may fail to resolve any potential disputes. Any of these risks, including our ability to effectuate any additional transactions at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, which may limit our ability to raise sufficient capital for our required investments.In addition, as part of our Smart Capital approach, we have applied for, received, and expect to receive additional grants and incentives from domestic and foreign local, regional, and national governments. Legislation in the US and EU has been adopted to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions. However, any amounts, if any, we may receive under any agreements enabled by such legislation may not be sufficient in amount or timeliness to support our capital investment plans and offset the higher costs of operations in many of the locations of our facilities as compared to those of many of our competitors, we may be unable to comply with the requirements and limitations of any such grants and incentives, or such agreements may contain restrictions that limit our flexibility to pursue changes in business strategy or transactions that may enhance stockholder value. For example, in November 2024 we entered into a direct funding agreement with the US Department of Commerce under the CHIPS Act that contains detailed milestones we must achieve for us to receive the funds, including with respect to achievement of various milestones with respect to capital expenditures, facility completion, process technology development, wafer production, Intel products insourcing, and external foundry customer acquisitions. It also contains restrictions on certain “change of control” transactions we are permitted to engage in, a requirement that we share with the US government project returns above specified thresholds, and various termination rights and remedies if we were to breach the agreement, including potential repayment of some or all of the awards. To the extent funding is below our expectations, we elect not to accept any grants or incentives due to burdensome compliance requirements, we are required to return any amounts received from any grants or incentives due to an inability to comply with any requirements or limitations contained therein, we are subject to restrictions as a result of any awards we have accepted, or the US government delays or does not provide any awards Risk Factors and Other Key Information34Table of Contentsthat have been agreed upon, our anticipated cash requirements may increase, our strategy, business and financial results may be adversely affected, and we may be constrained in our ability to engage in transactions that are in the best interests of our stockholders.Changes in product demand and margins can adversely affect our financial results. Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our products varies within or among them. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, we expect the PC TAM to grow over time, driven by factors such as a larger installed base, demand for AI capabilities, new platforms, shorter replacement cycles, and adoption in new markets; however, the PC industry has been highly cyclical in the past, and these growth expectations may not materialize, or we may fail to capitalize on them. Changes in the demand for our products have in the past and may in the future reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.Important factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:▪business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;▪consumer confidence, income levels, and customer capital spending, which can be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing or spending, taxation, interest rates, the credit market, current or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;▪customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user computing workloads, such as the shift in data center spend to GPUs to support AI workloads;▪geopolitical conditions, including trade policies, potential tariffs or other trade restrictions, and geopolitical tensions and conflicts;▪our ability to timely introduce competitive products; ▪competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;▪the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;▪customer order patterns and order cancellations, including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products, customers' products, and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles; and ▪disruptions affecting customers, such as the delays in obtaining tools, components, and other supplies as a result of COVID-19-related port shutdowns in China that negatively impacted demand for our business in 2022, as well as the industry substrate and component shortages that negatively impacted demand across several of our businesses in 2021.Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our core product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms to higher-end platforms. Our ancillary product offerings that extend beyond our core product lines typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced products, and at times are not profitable. Some of our higher-priced products, however, such as the Intel Core Ultra 200V processors launched in September 2024, have lower margins as they are produced at external foundries rather than in our manufacturing facilities. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-margin to lower-margin products in any of our market segments, as has been the case with the Intel Core Ultra 200V processors, our gross margin percentage has decreased and may decrease again.Macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including changes to trade policies and regulations, present significant risks to us in many jurisdictions.We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Our operations rely upon a supply chain that is also highly distributed, and with reliance in some instances on supplies or materials available in only one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the US accounted for 76% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, with revenue from billings to China contributing 29% of our total revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to execute our business strategy, manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control.Adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth; changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy; high interest rates; tighter credit; inflation; lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure; increases in unemployment; and lower consumer confidence and spending. Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to: increased credit and collectability risks; higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital and credit markets; reduced liquidity; adverse impacts on our suppliers; failures of counterparties, including financial institutions and insurers; asset impairments; and declines in the value of our financial instruments. Trade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets. They can also result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us. Sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long-term Risk Factors and Other Key Information35Table of Contentschanges in global trade and technology supply chains, domestic sourcing initiatives, and decoupling of global trade networks, which could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets and have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.In particular, geopolitical and trade tensions between the US and China, one of our largest markets, have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to some of our products, and have affected customer ordering patterns. Further, the US has imposed restrictions on the export of US-regulated products and technology to certain Chinese technology companies, including certain of our customers. Specifically, in 2022 the US significantly increased US export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and on AI and advanced computing products. In 2023, the US added to the restrictions in all three areas and also worked with Japan and the Netherlands to align on additional restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment. In 2024, the US Commerce Department further expanded export controls to limit the global distribution of high-performance integrated circuits by restricting sales through customer allocations and imposing per-country caps. During this time, the US has increasingly added Chinese companies to prohibited lists. In response, China has restricted US access to certain minerals and has blocked certain companies that provide products to Taiwan's military from selling products in China. These restrictions have in some instances reduced our sales and in a number of instances required specific governmental authorizations or exceptions. These and potential future restrictions, including also through application of antitrust laws and restrictions based on cybersecurity and other national security concerns, could adversely affect our financial performance and result in reputational harm to us. In addition, a number of semiconductor companies in China, including SMIC, are making significant investments, in many instances with the support of the Chinese government, in advanced semiconductor technologies to enable such companies to develop products and technologies that compete with ours. It is difficult to predict what further trade-related actions governments may take, whether the 2025 change in US administration may heighten tensions, the extent to which we may be able to mitigate the effects of any trade-related actions, and the longer-term implications of trade-related actions on the market opportunities for us and the competition we may face.Geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and terrorist activity, present significant risks to our global operations. For example:▪There has been a significant escalation in tensions and hostilities affecting or in close proximity to Israel, where we have a leading-edge fabrication facility and multiple product development centers. As a significant portion of our revenues are generated from products on Intel 7 manufactured at our fabrication facility in Israel and we are not insured for business interruptions, a disruption of that facility could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Additionally, our property, plant, and equipment assets in Israel are self-insured and could be impacted by the conflict. Further, our Mobileye business is headquartered and has most of its operations in Israel and could be similarly impacted.▪Tensions between mainland China and Taiwan have increased significantly in recent years, presenting an elevated risk of hostilities. Many of our products and all of our more advanced products depend on suppliers in Taiwan for critical components, including various compute die, that cannot be easily or quickly replaced. Other of our products, including some of our most recently introduced products, are made entirely in Taiwan. As such, any disruption impacting Taiwan could significantly and adversely impact our ability to obtain critical components and supply our customers with products.▪Russia’s ongoing conflict with Ukraine has resulted in the imposition of financial and other sanctions and export controls against Russia and Belarus that has caused us and other companies to limit or suspend Russian operations (we had no exports to Russia in 2023 and 2024). The conflict has also resulted in Russia-imposed currency restrictions and regulations and other retaliatory trade and other actions, increased supply, commodity, and other costs, and an increased risk of cyberattacks.We can also be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur, including:▪severe weather events and natural disasters, public health issues (including pandemics), and other catastrophic events;▪inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions, materials shortages or delays, and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;▪formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and changes in the ability to obtain export licenses, which could be changed without notice;▪government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from or distribute compensation or other funds in a particular country;▪adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives, including more favorable incentives provided to competitors;▪differing employment practices and labor issues, including restricted access to talent;▪ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;▪local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;▪continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the US and abroad; and▪fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, and in the capital and credit markets, which can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, interest rate changes, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors.We are subject to numerous risks associated with the evolving market for products with AI capabilities.The markets and use cases for products with AI capabilities have been rapidly evolving, are difficult to predict, and may impact demand for our products. For example, in the last few years, the demand for high-end GPUs for model training increased dramatically and has resulted and may continue to result in a significant shift in data center customer spend. The significant investments we have made and Risk Factors and Other Key Information36Table of Contentsexpect to continue to make to develop products and software to address what we believe will be increasing demand for AI capabilities, most notably in AI PCs but also in the data center and in GPUs, may be insufficient, and we face significant hurdles, including whether demand will materialize, whether third-party developers will develop the software to utilize the AI capabilities of our products, and whether we will be successful in developing products that can compete with offerings by established competitors. Our use of AI technology may subject us to reputational, financial, legal, or regulatory risks. As we incorporate AI technology into our products and services, any failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of the evolving AI technology in our products and services may cause harm to our reputation or financial liability and, as such, may increase our costs to address or mitigate such risks and issues. AI technology may create ethical issues, generate defective algorithms, and present other risks that create challenges with respect to its adoption. In addition, evolving laws, rules, regulations, and industry standards governing AI may require us to expend significant resources to modify, maintain, or align our business practices or products.We rely upon a complex global supply chain.We have a highly complex global supply chain composed of thousands of suppliers. These suppliers provide direct materials for our production processes; supply tools, equipment, and IP (via licenses) for our factories; deliver logistics and packaging services; and supply software, lab, and office equipment, and other goods and services used in our business. We also rely on suppliers to provide certain components for our products and to manufacture and assemble and test some of our components and products. From time to time, we are negatively impacted by supply chain issues, including:▪suppliers extending lead times, experiencing capacity constraints, limiting or canceling supply, allocating supply to other customers including competitors, delaying or canceling deliveries, or increasing prices;▪supplier quality issues;▪cybersecurity events, IP or other litigation, man-made or natural disasters, public health issues (including pandemics), operational failures, or other events that disrupt suppliers;▪long lead times to qualify alternate or additional suppliers, or the unavailability of qualified alternate suppliers; and▪increased legislation, regulation, or stakeholder expectations regarding sourcing, including with respect to national security, human rights and environmental impact concerns.These and other supply chain issues can increase our costs, disrupt or reduce our production, delay our product shipments, prevent us from meeting customer demand, damage our customer relationships, or negatively affect our reputation. They may keep us from successfully implementing our business strategy and can materially harm our business, competitive position, results of operations, and financial condition. From time to time, our customers experience disruptions or shortages in their own supply chains that constrain their demand for our products. During the past several years, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, as well as outbreaks of COVID-19, caused supply chain disruptions and delays in obtaining tools and other components, and the semiconductor industry experienced widespread shortages of substrates and other components and available foundry manufacturing capacity. These shortages have previously limited our ability to supply customer demand in certain of our businesses, and have adversely affected customer demand for our products, as some customers have been unable to procure sufficient quantities of third-party components used together with our products to produce finished systems. It is difficult to predict the future impact of these shortages when they occur.To obtain future supply of certain materials and components, particularly substrates, and third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, we have entered into arrangements with some of our suppliers that involve long-term purchase commitments and/or large prepayments. These arrangements may not be adequate to meet our requirements, or our suppliers may fail to deliver committed volumes on time or at all, or their financial condition may deteriorate. If future customer demand over the horizon of such arrangements falls below our expectations, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, unneeded capacity, and increased costs, and our prepayments may not be fully utilized, and in some cases may not be fully recoverable. We utilize third-party foundries and component suppliers to manufacture or supply a number of our products and components necessary for our products that we manufacture. As part of our strategy, we expect to continue to rely upon third-party foundries. Delays in the development of foundries' future manufacturing processes could delay the introduction of products or components we design for such processes, and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent us from meeting customer demand. We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, yields, quality, product quantities, and costs for components and products that are manufactured by third parties. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply. However, for certain products, components, services, materials, and equipment, we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location, which can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. For example, ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) is currently the sole supplier of EUV lithography tools that we are deploying in our Intel 4 and subsequent leading-edge manufacturing process nodes. These tools are highly complex to develop and produce, and increasingly costly, and from time to time there are increases in lead times or delays in their development and availability, which could delay the development or ramp of our future process nodes. As a further example, a limited number of third-party foundries offer leading-edge manufacturing processes, and these providers are geographically concentrated in Asia. Some of our most advanced current and future products are or will be either exclusively manufactured by TSMC or reliant upon critical components, including various compute die, manufactured by TSMC. We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues. From time to time, we identify product defects, errata, and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or gain Risk Factors and Other Key Information37Table of Contentsthrough acquisitions, can also contain defects. Product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third-party products and software. We face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or applications, including transportation, autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses. Costs from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:▪writing off some or all of the value of inventory;▪recalling products that have been shipped;▪providing product replacements or modifications;▪providing consideration to customers, including reimbursement for certain costs they incur;▪defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages;▪paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies; and▪reputational harm.These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and/or result in delay or loss of revenue. Mitigation techniques designed to address product issues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis—or at all—and do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues for all applications. We and third parties, such as hardware and software vendors, make prioritization decisions about which product issues to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation and result in costs. Product defects, errata, or other product issues and/or mitigation techniques can result in product failures, adverse performance and power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and other issues. For example, during 2024, some of our customers experienced instability issues when using Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors, which required us to undertake an investigation and deploy corrective actions. This adversely impacted sales volume during 2024 and may result in higher warranty costs in the future.Product issues can damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases or deployment, result in legal liability, or make our products less competitive, which could harm our business and financial results. Subsequent events or new information can develop that change our assessment of the impact of a product issue. In addition, our liability insurance coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products.We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products, as well as the operating systems and workloads that run on them and the components that interact with them. Components and IP we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard specifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. Our processors and other products are being used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category known as side-channel vulnerabilities, such as the variants referred to as \"Spectre\" and \"Meltdown.\" Additional categories and variants have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified. Security and manageability features in our products cannot make our products absolutely secure, and these features themselves are subject to vulnerabilities and attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a security vulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become aware of additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products, and address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.Mitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities in our products, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, are not always available on a timely basis—or at all—and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness, and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether, when, and how to develop and deploy mitigations. Export restrictions may impede our ability to provide updates or patches to customers in certain geographies or that appear on sanctions lists, potentially leaving systems unpatched and open to exploitation. Further, sanctions lists may include third parties with whom we need to interact for coordinated vulnerability disclosure, which may impair our ability to receive information about vulnerabilities and to deliver mitigations for them. We and such third parties make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation. Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties.Risk Factors and Other Key Information38Table of ContentsSecurity vulnerabilities and any limitations or adverse effects of mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For example, whether or not vulnerabilities involve attempted or successful exploits, they may result in our incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, providing product replacements or modifications, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. These effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are available, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation. We are subject to increasing and evolving cybersecurity threats and privacy risks.We face significant and persistent cybersecurity risks due to: the breadth of geographies, networks, and systems we must defend against cybersecurity attacks; the complexity, technical sophistication, value, and widespread use of our systems, products, and processes; the attractiveness of our systems, products, and processes to threat actors (including state-sponsored organizations) seeking to inflict harm on us or our customers; the substantial level of harm that could occur to us and our customers were we to suffer impacts of a material cybersecurity incident; and our use of third-party products, services, and components. Such an incident, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding our internal systems, writing down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation or enforcement proceedings, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain a business relationship with us, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties, as well as incurring significant reputational harm. We regularly face attempts by malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our suppliers, customers, partners, end users, or other third parties; steal proprietary, personal, or confidential information related to our business, products, employees, suppliers, or customers; sabotage our systems or those of our suppliers, customers, partners, end users, or other third parties; interrupt our systems and services or those of our suppliers, customers, or others; or demand ransom to return control of such systems and services. As we operate and expect to grow certain emerging business lines, such as our third-party foundry business and our cloud computing and SaaS offerings, we expect to collect or host significant amounts of highly sensitive customer data, which may increasingly make us a target of attempts to steal or corrupt that data. Individuals and organizations, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored organizations, insider threats including employees and third-party service providers, and intruders into our physical facilities, at times attempt to gain unauthorized access to and/or corrupt the processes used to design and manufacture our hardware products and our associated software and services. We are also a frequent target of attackers that intend to sabotage, compromise, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. In some instances, we, our suppliers, our customers, and the users of our products and services may be unaware of a threat or incident or its magnitude and effects, or we may be unable to timely mitigate the impacts of an incident.Cyber attack attempts are increasing in number, magnitude, and technical sophistication, and if successful, may expose us and the affected parties to loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions to our business operations, including our manufacturing operations, and could impact our financial results. We expect emerging technologies to contribute to the increasing sophistication of attacks and to lead to new threats. For example, threat actors are leveraging emerging AI technologies to develop new hacking tools and attack vectors, exploit vulnerabilities, obscure their activities, and increase the difficulty of threat attribution. The proliferation of generative AI increases the risk of these technologies being used by threat actors to impersonate authorized individuals, which may make attacks even more difficult to detect and prevent. Moreover, the increased adoption of generative AI models within our internal systems, processes, and tools may create new attack methods for threat actors.As a developer of leading-edge manufacturing process nodes and widely utilized semiconductor processors and other products, we have been, and expect to continue to be, the subject of intense efforts by sophisticated cyber adversaries, including state-sponsored organizations, who seek to compromise our systems, disrupt our operations or those of users of our products, or steal trade secrets. As geopolitical or armed global conflicts escalate, attacks against us, our customers, or our strategic allies may similarly intensify. For example, from 2019 to 2021, we, along with other companies with meaningful operations in Israel, were targets of concerted cyberattacks. In the fourth quarter of 2020, our Habana Labs subsidiary's network was breached in connection with a suspected unsuccessful ransomware attack, resulting in unauthorized third-party access of certain confidential information.We are also subject to risks associated with attacks on products, services, and components in our supply chain, such as the 2020 compromise of IT infrastructure management software provided by SolarWinds Corporation, and risks from vulnerabilities in using industry-wide software solutions and third-party components, such as the 2021 Log4Shell vulnerability and similar vulnerabilities that followed. The CrowdStrike outage that occurred in 2024 is another example of the risks we face from utilizing products and components that are widely adopted in supply chains. These providers can experience breaches of their systems and products, or provide inadequate updates or support, which can impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or confidential information. Since 2021, we have observed an increase in ransomware attacks in our supply chain.We are required to comply with stringent, complex, and evolving laws, rules, regulations, and standards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to cybersecurity and data privacy. Any failure or perceived failure by us to so comply, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, modification, acquisition, disclosure, release, or transfer of personal information, may result in our having to modify or cease certain operations or practices; the expenditure of substantial costs, time, and other resources; legal proceedings or actions against us (including class action lawsuits); or governmental investigations.Risk Factors and Other Key Information39Table of ContentsThe theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business, including data stored with vendors or other third parties, could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Costs to comply with and implement privacy-related and data-protection measures are significant, and noncompliance could expose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and even criminal sanctions.We are subject to IP risks, including related litigation and regulatory proceedings. We cannot always protect our IP or enforce our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP and IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries and other geopolitical factors. We are not always able to obtain protection for our IP or enforce or protect our IP rights. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. From time to time, governments adopt regulations and governments or courts render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and business. In some cases, our IP rights can offer inadequate protection for our innovations. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced.Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to some of our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.Third parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business. We face claims based on IP rights from individuals, companies, investment litigation entities, other non-practicing entities, academic and research institutions, and other parties. We have seen an increase in patent assertions and lawsuits initiated by well-funded non-practicing entities, including entities funded by third-party investment firms. These lawsuits can increase our cost of doing business, impact our reputation or relationship with customers, and disrupt our operations if they succeed in blocking the trade of our products. The patent litigation environment has also become more challenging due to the emergence of venues adopting procedural and substantive rules that make them more favorable for patent asserters and courts in which injunctions are available for non-competitors. For example, in February 2024, R2 Semiconductor, Inc., a non-practicing entity, was able to obtain an injunction and recall order against us and our customers in the Dusseldorf Regional Court in Germany that, if enforced, could have caused significant potential disruption to our and our customers’ businesses in Europe. In the past few years, we have faced costly and lengthy lawsuits across multiple jurisdictions selected by non-practicing entities with well-funded third-party investment support, including most notably the VLSI and R2 litigation, which have resulted in significant adverse judgments and settlements.We are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products, technologies, or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets, confidential information, or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, in many instances, we agree to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers' businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.As a result of IP rights claims, we could:▪pay monetary damages, payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, royalties, fines, penalties, or provide accommodations to customers such as through cash payments or discounts;▪stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;▪need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or▪enter into settlement or license agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and may be costly.These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Many of our products are designed to include third-party technology or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. In addition, from time to time, third parties notify us that they believe we are using their IP. There is no assurance that any necessary licenses or our existing licenses to such third-party IP can be obtained or are available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party technology, or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or Risk Factors and Other Key Information40Table of Contentsotherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. To the extent our products include software that contains or is derived from open-source software, we may be required to make the software's source code publicly available and/or license the software under open-source licensing terms.We are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory matters. From time to time, we face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, commercial, IP, labor and employment, compliance, and other issues. As described in \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events have occurred and could occur again, including monetary damages, fines, penalties, or injunctions stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, harmful to our reputation, and distracting to management.We must attract, retain, and motivate key talent. We believe that hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical talent, sales representatives, and other professionals are critical to our business. The competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense, with the demand often exceeding supply. Competitors for technical talent often seek to hire our employees, and the availability of flexible, hybrid, or work-from-home arrangements has both intensified and expanded competition. In addition, changes in immigration policies may further limit the pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. From time to time, we have intensified our efforts to recruit and retain talent, such as during 2021 and the first half of 2022, and these efforts have increased our expenses. Further, we may not be successful in attracting, retaining, and motivating the workforce necessary to deliver on our strategy, and we have been required to curtail our planned hiring and reduce our workforce to respond to business conditions that have differed from our expectations, which can be disruptive, adversely impact employee morale, compromise our ability to deliver on our strategy and workforce goals, and impact our ability to recruit in the future. For example, we undertook significant headcount reductions in 2022 and 2024. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. Sustained declines in our stock price or lower stock price performance relative to our competitors have reduced the retention value of our share-based awards, which can impact the competitiveness of our compensation. To the extent our compensation programs and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive, or changes in our workforce and related restructuring, reduction-in-force, or other initiatives are not viewed favorably, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees can be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. In addition, significant or prolonged turnover may negatively impact our operations and culture, as well as our ability to successfully maintain our processes and procedures, including due to the loss of historical, technical, and other expertise.Changes in our management team can also disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, given the long development cycle for semiconductor process technologies and products and the large capital investments over a long time period required for semiconductor manufacturing operations. We have had a number of changes in our senior leadership team in recent years, including our CEO and other senior management positions. For example, in December 2024, our most recent CEO retired after less than four years with the company and a search is currently underway for a new CEO. To the extent we do not effectively hire, onboard, retain, and motivate key employees and leadership, our business may be harmed.We are subject to risks associated with our strategic transactions and investments.We routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:▪our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;▪failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and failure of its anticipated benefits to materialize;▪disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management's attention;▪failure of partners to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely;▪our inability to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding a project, property, or entity;▪failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, or at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals on a timely basis or without materially burdensome conditions or mandated acquisitions, divestitures, or disposals, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or other unforeseen factors;▪our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, such as the $2.9 billion charge we recorded in the third quarter of 2024 primarily related to Mobileye goodwill, and restructuring charges;▪our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses;▪our inability to retain key personnel of acquired or majority-owned businesses or our difficulty in integrating or separating employees, business systems, and technology or otherwise operating the acquired or majority-owned business;▪controls, processes, and procedures of acquired or majority-owned businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations and create complexity and inconsistency in application of controls, processes and procedures, and our failure to identify and/or address compliance issues, including accounting or tax errors, or liabilities;▪our inability to resolve impasses or disputes with partners, including as a result of differences in our interests or goals;Risk Factors and Other Key Information41Table of Contents▪our failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, accounting, tax, and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets, majority-owned businesses, or novel transactions; and▪the potential for our transactions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt.Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition, divestiture or partial divestiture, or several concurrent strategic transactions. Moreover, our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we at times need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions or otherwise investing our resources in a manner that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives. We are subject to sales-related risks.We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties, such as distributors, value-added resellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs and ODMs. We depend on many distributors to help us create end-customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. At times, we rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products is limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products is not always easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties often sell products that compete with our products, and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. From time to time, they may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Further, any violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business, including subjecting us to litigation or regulatory risk. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.From time to time, our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized \"gray market.\" Our policies and procedures designed to keep our products away from the gray market may not be successful in achieving this objective. Gray market products can distort demand and pricing dynamics in our distribution channel and certain geographies, which at times adversely affects our revenue opportunities. Gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more challenging. Gray market products also sometimes include parts that have been altered or damaged, and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to be substandard. We receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Collectively, our three largest customers accounted for 45% of our net revenue in 2024, 40% of our net revenue in 2023 and 42% of our net revenue in 2022. We expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. The loss of key customers, a substantial reduction in sales to them, or changes in the timing of their orders can lead to a reduction in our revenue, increase the volatility of our results, and harm our results of operations and financial condition.Industry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increased the significance and purchasing power of certain customers, particularly hyperscalers, in some of our data center-focused businesses. The cloud and cloud applications represent an increasingly demanding computing environment. The further consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and applications; product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product security and security features. Our competitive position can be eroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors. We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, including serving cloud service provider customers, and the competitive environment adversely affected our results in the last few years. Some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including designs customized for their specific computing workloads. In addition, cloud services can be marketed to end users based on service levels or features rather than hardware specifications, or they can abstract hardware under layers of software, which can make it more difficult to differentiate our products to customers and end users. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely affected, and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads from their own internal data center infrastructures to cloud service providers. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud customer specifications, order changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs. Risk Factors and Other Key Information42Table of ContentsWe face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from both US and non-US governments associated with grants, incentives, and sales of our products and services, and we are seeking to increase our sales of products and services to governmental entities in the future. Government demand and payment are often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including, with respect to US government contracts, congressional approval of appropriations, and can be adversely impacted by shutdowns of the US federal government and changes in US administration, including administrative priorities. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, certain agreements with the US government are subject to special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, security, customers, and/or employees, and failure or inability to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or debarment from future business with the US government.We face risks related to our debt obligations.We have incurred significant debt obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including our ability to fully implement our strategy. As of December 28, 2024, we had $51.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and other borrowings outstanding. In addition, we have a commercial paper program of up to $10.0 billion and credit facilities to backstop these programs and otherwise provide access to committed capital of up to $15.0 billion. As we continue to pursue our strategy, we expect to incur additional indebtedness, refinance our existing debt, and issue additional notes or other debt securities in the future at a variety of interest rates, maturities, and terms. The semiconductor industry is a cyclical business and our revenue, cash flows, and outlook often fluctuate in accordance with this cycle, as well as prevailing macroeconomic conditions, our business strategy, and other risks described in these risk factors. These fluctuations, together with our debt level and related debt service obligations, could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing the risk of a future downgrade in our credit ratings that can impact the value of our outstanding debt and increase our borrowing costs. During 2024 and in prior years, we suffered multiple credit rating downgrades that adversely impacted our borrowing costs and access to capital, and we may continue to suffer additional such downgrades if our business and financial results do not measurably improve. We may also be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, debt refinancing, future acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, which will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Consequently, we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could adversely impact our ability to finance our business strategy and service and repay outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due, all of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and the cost of borrowing. We have ceased to return capital to stockholders. In recent years, we have not made repurchases of our stock and reduced, and then suspended in the fourth quarter of 2024, our quarterly dividend. Further, we agreed under our commercial CHIPS Act agreement to forgo paying dividends for the next two years, and agreed to limitations on the payment of dividends for the three years thereafter. There can be no assurance that we will be able to pay dividends in the future. In addition, we are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program and there can be no assurances as to the amount, timing, and execution of any future share repurchases, or that any repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. Laws and regulations can have a negative impact on our business. We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions and affect our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy and localization requirements; competition; advertising; employment and labor; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. For example, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G or autonomous driving technology and MaaS may limit global adoption, impede our strategy, or negatively impact our long-term expectations for our investments in these areas. Expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data-protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and services, particularly in cloud, Internet of Things, and AI applications, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads.Our policies, controls, and procedures designed to help provide for compliance with applicable laws cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.We are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in US dollars, operating expenses and capital expenditures may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the US where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as non-US dollar capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates can harm our results of operations and financial condition. Risk Factors and Other Key Information43Table of ContentsChanges in our effective tax rate may impact our net income. A number of factors can impact our future effective tax rate or cash payments, which could cause significant variability in our financial results, including:▪changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;▪changes in our business or legal entity operating model;▪the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;▪changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;▪adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of tax returns;▪increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;▪changes in available tax credits, including non-US tax credits, R&D credits, and refundable tax credits;▪expirations or changes in our ability to secure new tax holidays and incentives;▪changes in US federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including the global implementation of a minimum tax under Pillar Two of the OECD BEPS initiative;▪changes in US GAAP and non-US IFRS; and▪our decision to repatriate non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for incremental taxes, including any local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.Catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations and business, and those of our customers and suppliers, can be disrupted by: severe weather events and natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health issues and global pandemics such as COVID-19; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation restrictions or disruptions, telecommunications, or IT systems providers; manufacturing equipment failures; geopolitical conflict; terrorism; or other catastrophic events. For example, we have at times experienced disruptions in our manufacturing processes as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, and disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, including cybersecurity incidents affecting our suppliers. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change can result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities, including our facilities located in water-sensitive regions such as Arizona and Israel. In addition, to the extent we are unable to successfully manage and conserve water resources, our reputation could be harmed. In recent years, the west coast of the US has experienced significant wildfires, including in Oregon, where we have major manufacturing facilities, and in California, where we are headquartered. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the technology industry in particular are unclear but could be severe. We are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, safety, and product regulations. The design, manufacturing, assembly, and test of our products require the use and purchase of materials and chemicals that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our operations and those of our suppliers are further governed by regulations prohibiting the use of forced labor (e.g., mining conflict minerals), and restrictions on other materials, as well as laws or regulations governing the operation of our facilities, sale and distribution of our products, and use of our real property. The scope and interpretation of such laws and regulations, including the materials they govern, are complex and continue to evolve. The procedures and processes in place under our compliance program may become onerous or increasingly expensive to maintain and cannot guarantee compliance by employees or third parties to whom such laws apply. The amendment or expansion of these laws or regulations, as well as our failure or inability to comply with them (including as a result of acquired entities), can result in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; increased costs; additional remediation obligations; suspension of production; alteration, suspension, or termination of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes, including due to an inability to find, afford, or attain adequate substitute materials, equipment, or processes; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. In addition, the failure or inability to comply by our suppliers of these materials can require us to suspend or alter our production processes and sources, and result in increased risks and costs.The failure or inability by us, our customers, or our suppliers to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental regulations, including with respect to the materials and processes we are permitted to use and as to air quality and wastewater requirements, may impede our ability to manufacture products or expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future. Environmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, cease the use of a particular material or process, remove or remediate hazardous substances, or incur other expenses or liabilities. Regulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements. For example, semiconductor manufacturing uses perfluorocarbons, which have historically made up a large portion of our direct greenhouse gas emissions. New or increased regulations limiting the use of such compounds, or other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to install additional abatement equipment, purchase carbon offsets, and/or alter, where feasible, our production processes and sources. In addition, new or increased climate change regulation could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities. Regulations in response to human health concerns may also limit or prohibit the use of a class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are found in parts, components, process chemicals, and other materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. Such chemicals are critical to the manufacturing and functioning of many semiconductor products and there are limited Risk Factors and Other Key Information44Table of Contentstechnically and commercially feasible alternatives. As we expand our manufacturing capacity, the impacts of future regulation could be magnified. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations are also subject to regulation under environmental laws. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.Our initiatives and new legal requirements with respect to corporate responsibility matters present various risks. Our corporate responsibility initiatives could expose us to heightened scrutiny and numerous financial, legal, reputational, operational, compliance, and other risks, including lost customer opportunities, which could negatively impact us. Our achievement of initiatives, aspirations, and goals related to corporate responsibility matters, including those related to sustainability, is not guaranteed and is subject to numerous conditions, risks, and expectations, as well as standards, processes, and methodologies that continue to evolve. Further, any failure to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives that meet our stakeholders' evolving expectations could also negatively impact us.In addition, we are or expect to become subject to various new or proposed climate-related and other sustainability laws and regulations, including, for example, the state of California's new climate change disclosure requirements, the EU's new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, and the SEC's recently adopted climate-change disclosure requirements. Compliance with such laws and regulations, as well as the overall increased focus and scrutiny from regulators, investors, customers, vendors, employees, and other stakeholders concerning ESG and climate matters, could impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks, including resulting in changes to our current ESG goals.Sales and Marketing CustomersWe design, market, sell, and service CPUs and other semiconductor solutions substantially through our Intel Products business that are manufactured by our Intel Foundry business and other suppliers and are incorporated in computing and related end products and services, and utilized globally by consumers, enterprises, governments, and educational organizations. We sell our products primarily to OEMs, ODMs, and cloud service providers. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For information on customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated net revenue, see \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase Intel processors and other products from our distributors. Certain of our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets.Sales ArrangementsOur products are sold through distribution channels throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. Because our customers generally order from us on a purchase order basis, they can typically cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using electronic and web-based processes that allow customers to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.In accordance with contract terms, the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, usually 30 days after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. DistributionDistributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.Risk Factors and Other Key Information45Table of ContentsSeasonal TrendsHistorically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. In 2024 and 2023, our net revenue seasonality was directionally consistent with this historical trend. In 2022, we had a flatter trend than we historically observe as we experienced the uncertainty and impacts, including demand volatility and supply chain disruption, of macroeconomic conditions, the potential for a recession, and the risk for continued COVID-19-related disruptions or shutdowns. MarketingOur global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, differentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives preference with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and Intel Xeon trademarks make up our key CPU brands. This year we introduced our new Intel Core Ultra processors, powering the latest AI PCs, and our Intel Xeon 6 processors, built with AI acceleration in every core. Our foundry services business aims to offer leading-edge packaging and process technology, geographically balanced manufacturing capacity, and a world-class IP portfolio.In addition to bringing new products to market in 2024, we focus on building brand awareness and driving demand through our own direct marketing and co-marketing programs with partners. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and public relations. We market to consumer and commercial audiences. Our key messaging reinforces the Intel brand pillars of exceptionally engineered, collaboratively innovative, and responsibly built, while emphasizing our ability to bring AI everywhere across data center, cloud, edge, and PC.Certain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs. These cooperative advertising and marketing programs broaden the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Certain customers are licensed to place Intel® logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to customers meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations.Risk Factors and Other Key Information46Table of ContentsQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not eliminate, the impacts of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange RatesWe are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-US-dollar-denominated investments in debt and equity instruments, and may economically hedge these risks with foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts, currency swaps, or interest rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-US-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in US dollars. However, a portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies, primarily the Israeli shekel, the Malaysian ringgit, the European Union euro, the Japanese yen, and the Chinese yuan. We have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-US-dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-US-dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards or option contracts in these hedging programs. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 10% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions outstanding as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 would result in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $54 million and less than $53 million, respectively.Interest RatesWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and provide financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally track SOFR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into SOFR-based returns. We also entered into swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into floating-rate coupon payments for a portion of our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.A hypothetical change in benchmark interest rates of 1%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our investment portfolio of less than $100 million as of December 28, 2024 and as of December 30, 2023.Taking into account fixed-rate debt that is swapped to floating-rate debt, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 1% would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $120 million from debt outstanding as of December 28, 2024 ($120 million from debt outstanding as of December 30, 2023).Equity PricesWe are exposed to equity market risk through our investments in marketable equity securities, which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activities. As of December 28, 2024, the fair value of our marketable equity securities was $0.8 billion ($1.2 billion as of December 30, 2023). The substantial majority of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of December 28, 2024 was concentrated in securities traded on the Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity securities, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio. Assuming a decline of 55% in market prices, the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by $466 million, based on the value as of December 28, 2024 (a decrease in value of $418 million, based on the value as of December 30, 2023 using an assumed decline of 35%). We utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities.Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as IPOs, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $4.5 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($4.6 billion as of December 30, 2023). Risk Factors and Other Key Information47Table of ContentsCommodity Price RiskAlthough we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities. CybersecurityWe face significant and persistent cybersecurity risks due to: the breadth of geographies, networks, and systems we must defend against cybersecurity attacks; the complexity, technical sophistication, value, and widespread use of our systems, products and processes; the attractiveness of our systems, products, and processes to threat actors (including state-sponsored organizations) seeking to inflict harm on us or our customers; the substantial level of harm that could occur to us and our customers were we to suffer impacts of a material cybersecurity incident; and our use of third-party products, services, and components. We are committed to maintaining robust governance and oversight of cybersecurity risks and to implementing mechanisms, controls, technologies, and processes designed to help us assess, identify, and manage these risks. See \"Risk Factors\" for more information on our cybersecurity risks and product vulnerability risks. While we have not, as of the date of this Form 10-K, experienced a cybersecurity threat or incident that resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations, there can be no guarantee that we will not experience such an incident in the future. We have seen an increase in cyberattack volume, frequency, and sophistication. Our cybersecurity program and governance approach are designed to protect our network and information systems, and we have policies, procedures, processes, and controls in place to identify, manage, and respond to risks from cybersecurity threats. We seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their occurrence and recurrence where practicable through changes or updates to our internal processes and tools and changes or updates to our products and services; however, we remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats. In some instances, we, our suppliers, our customers, and the users of our products and services can be unaware of a threat or incident or its magnitude and effects. Further, there is increasing regulation regarding responses to cybersecurity incidents, including reporting to regulators, which could subject us to additional liability and reputational harm. We aim to incorporate industry best practices throughout our cybersecurity program. Our cybersecurity program includes written policies, standards, and procedures for information security, product security, and data privacy; is designed to be aligned with applicable industry standards; and is assessed annually by independent third-party auditors. Our cybersecurity strategy focuses on implementing effective and efficient controls, technologies, and other processes to assess, identify, manage, and address material cybersecurity threats, risks, and incidents. These include, among other things: annual and ongoing security awareness training for employees; mechanisms to detect and monitor unusual network activity; and containment and incident response tools. We actively engage with industry groups for benchmarking and awareness of best practices. We monitor issues that are internally discovered or externally reported and have processes to assess those issues for potential cybersecurity impact or risk. We also have a process in place to manage cybersecurity risks associated with third-party service providers. We impose security requirements upon our suppliers, including: maintaining an effective security management program; abiding by information handling and asset management requirements; and notifying us in the event of any known or suspected cyber incident.Our Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of cybersecurity risk, which it manages as part of our enterprise risk management program. That program is utilized in making decisions with respect to company priorities, resource allocations, and oversight structures. The Board of Directors is assisted by the Audit & Finance Committee, which regularly reviews our cybersecurity program with management and reports to the Board of Directors. Cybersecurity reviews by the Audit & Finance Committee or the Board of Directors generally occur at least twice annually, or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable. A number of Intel directors have experience in assessing and managing cybersecurity risk. Our cybersecurity program is run by our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports to our Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Our CISO is informed about and monitors prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation efforts through regular communication and reporting from professionals in the information security team—many of whom hold cybersecurity certifications such as a Certified Information Systems Security Professional or Certified Information Security Manager—and through the use of technological tools and software and results from third-party audits. Our CISO and CTO have extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and cybersecurity risk. Our CISO has served in that position since 2015 and, before Intel, was the Chief Security Officer at McAfee and the Chief Information Officer and CISO for the US House of Representatives. Our CTO joined Intel in 2021 and was previously Senior Vice President and CTO at VMware, with responsibility for product security. Our CISO and CTO regularly report directly to the Audit & Finance Committee or the Board of Directors on our cybersecurity program and efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate issues. In addition, we have an escalation process in place to inform senior management and the Board of Directors of material issues.Risk Factors and Other Key Information48Table of ContentsPropertiesAs of December 28, 2024, our major facilities consisted of:(Square Feet in Millions)UnitedStatesOtherCountriesTotalOwned facilities35 28 63 Leased facilities3 4 7 Total facilities38 32 70 The facilities described above, including our principal executive offices located in the US, are suitable for our present purposes.

Our last share repurchase under this authorization occurred in Q1 2021, and no shares were repurchased during the fiscal year ending December 28, 2024. As of December 28, 2024, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of which $7.2 billion remained available. We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.Rule 10b5-1 Trading ArrangementsOur directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may from time to time enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5–1(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act.

On March 2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one such sanction. Though Intel has suspended sales in Russia, there may be a need to file documents or engage with FSB as Intel winds up our local Russian offices. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B issued by the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB. On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.Risk Factors and Other Key Information52Table of ContentsFinancial Statements and Supplemental DetailsWe have defined certain terms and abbreviations used throughout our Form 10-K in \"Key Terms\" within this section.Index to Consolidated Financial StatementsPageReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm(PCAOB ID: 42)54Consolidated Statements of Operations57Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss)58Consolidated Balance Sheets59Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows60Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity61Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements62BasisNote 1: Basis of Presentation62Note 2: Accounting Policies62Performance and OperationsNote 3: Operating Segments68Note 4: Non-Controlling Interests72Note 5: Earnings (Loss) Per Share74Note 6: Other Financial Statement Details74Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges77Note 8: Income Taxes78Investments, Long-Term Assets, and DebtNote 9: Investments81Note 10: Acquisitions and Divestitures82Note 11: Goodwill83Note 12: Identified Intangible Assets84Note 13: Borrowings84Note 14: Fair Value87Risk Management and OtherNote 15: Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)88Note 16: Derivative Financial Instruments88Note 17: Retirement Benefit Plans91Note 18: Employee Equity Incentive Plans94Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies96Key Terms100Index to Supplemental DetailsControls and Procedures102Exhibits103Form 10-K Cross-Reference Index10853Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel CorporationOpinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intel Corporation (the Company) as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 31, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Auditor's Reports54Table of ContentsInventory ValuationDescription of the MatterThe Company's net inventory totaled $12.2 billion as of December 28, 2024, representing 6.2% of total assets. As explained in \"Note 2: Accounting Policies\" within the consolidated financial statements, the Company computes inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and applies judgment in determining saleability of products and the valuation of inventories. The Company assesses inventory at each reporting date in order to assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the products have achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers; the determination of normal capacity levels in its manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory; whether the product is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of saleable quality. Auditing management's assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the determination of excess and obsolete inventory reserves and lower of cost or net realizable value is judgmental and considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as customer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand. Additionally, for certain new product launches there is limited historical data with which to evaluate forecasts.How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe evaluated the design and tested operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over the costing of inventory, the determination of whether inventory is of saleable quality, the determination of demand forecasts and related application against on hand inventory, and the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value reserves including related estimated costs and selling prices.Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions (e.g., estimated product demand forecasts, costs and selling prices) of the underlying data used in management's inventory valuation assessment. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends. We assessed whether there were any potential sources of contrary information, including historical forecast accuracy or history of significant revisions to previously recorded inventory valuation adjustments, and performed sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in inventory valuation that would result from changes in the assumptions.Goodwill Impairment Assessment – Mobileye Reporting UnitDescription of the MatterAt December 28, 2024, the balance of the Company’s goodwill was $24.7 billion. The goodwill attributed to the Mobileye reporting unit was $8.3 billion and represented 4.2% of total assets. As discussed in “Note 2: Accounting Policies” within the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The assessment may include both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. If it is determined, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. As discussed in “Note 11: Goodwill” to the consolidated financial statements, the Company identified certain impairment indicators in the three months ended September 28, 2024 that required an interim goodwill impairment test. As a result of this assessment, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $2.6 billion related to the Mobileye reporting unit. Auditing the Company’s Mobileye goodwill impairment evaluation was complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value using the income approach. Determining fair value involved assumptions with forward-looking elements that can be affected by future economic and market conditions. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as revenue terminal growth rate and the weighted average cost of capital.How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe evaluated the design and tested operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over the Mobileye reporting unit goodwill impairment review process, including controls over management’s review of the valuation model and the significant assumptions mentioned above.Our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the suitability and application of the valuation methodology and evaluating the significant assumptions (e.g., revenue terminal growth rate and the weighted average cost of capital) and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, market information, and other relevant factors. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to determine what changes in assumptions are particularly sensitive when assessing the likelihood of impairment, or when calculating the amount of the impairment. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates. In addition, we involved a valuation specialist to assist in the evaluation of the methodology used by the Company and certain significant assumptions. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP      We have served as the Company's auditor since 1968.San Jose, CaliforniaJanuary 31, 2025Auditor's Reports55Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel CorporationOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited Intel Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intel Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated January 31, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP                          San Jose, CaliforniaJanuary 31, 2025Auditor's Reports56Table of ContentsConsolidated Statements of

Equity61Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 : Basis of PresentationWe have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were 52-week fiscal years; 2022 was a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal 2025 is a 52-week fiscal year. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Intel and our wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, which include entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting interest models. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We made certain reclassifications within our Consolidated Financial Statements during 2024, and, in certain cases, adjusted prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income (loss), cash flows, or stockholders' equity.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates.Effective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 to 8 years. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, we estimated this change increased gross margin in 2023 by approximately $2.5 billion and decreased R&D expense by approximately $400 million. As of December 30, 2023, we estimated this change decreased ending inventory values by approximately $1.3 billion. These estimates were based on the assets in use and under construction as of the beginning of 2023 and were calculated at that point in time.Note 2 : Accounting PoliciesRevenue RecognitionWe recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or services to customers. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sales. Our products often include a software component, such as firmware, that is highly interdependent and interrelated with the product and is substantially accounted for as a combined performance obligation. In accordance with contract terms, the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms. We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Variable consideration is estimated and reflected as an adjustment to the transaction price. We determine variable consideration, which consists primarily of various sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. Sales rebates earned by customers are offset against their receivable balances. Rebates earned by customers when they do not have outstanding receivable balances are recorded within other accrued liabilities.We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs for marketing activities for some of our products. We generally record the payment as a reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned, unless the payment is for a distinct service, which we record as an expense when the marketing activities occur.Long-Lived AssetsProperty, Plant, and EquipmentWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated over the estimated useful life. At least annually, we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant, and equipment, considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives. Effective January 2023, the estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities were increased from 5 to 8 years. This change in estimate was applied prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2023. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements62Table of ContentsAssets are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If the carrying value of an asset grouping is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired.Identified Intangible AssetsWe amortize acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives. We perform periodic reviews of significant finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. These reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Periodically, we also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. We may adjust the period over which these assets are amortized to reflect the period over which they are expected to contribute to our cash flows.GoodwillOur reporting units substantially align with our operating segments. We reevaluate our identified reporting units annually or when triggered, such as upon reorganization of our operating segments. We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The reporting unit's carrying value used in an impairment assessment represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. The impairment assessment may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.Qualitative factors used include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. We may also perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value.Our quantitative impairment assessment considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. Significant estimates include market segment growth rates, our assumed market segment share, estimated gross margins, operating expenses, and discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. These estimates change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors and could materially affect the determination of the fair value and potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Our quantitative assessment is sensitive to changes in underlying estimates and assumptions, the most sensitive of which is the discount rate.InventoriesWe compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities and associated costs change in nature from R&D to cost of sales, and when cost of sales can be capitalized as inventory. For a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. We have identified the start of manufacturing volume for sale to customers as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. Prior to the start of manufacturing volume for sale to customers, costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost of sales in the period incurred.The valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities. We apply our historical loading compared to our total available capacity to determine our expectations of normal capacity level. If the factory loading is below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges were $174 million in 2024, $834 million in 2023, and $423 million in 2022.Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle, variations in market pricing, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. Lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserves fluctuate as we ramp new process technologies, with costs generally improving over time due to scale and improved yields. Additionally, inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical changes in market conditions and the associated pricing environment.The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We use a demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate of future demand to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we write off amounts considered to be excess inventory.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements63Table of ContentsGovernment IncentivesGovernment incentives, including cash grants and refundable tax credits, are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the incentive will be received and we will comply with the conditions specified in the agreement or statutory requirements. We record capital-related incentives as a reduction to property, plant, and equipment, net within our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize a reduction to depreciation expense over the useful life of the corresponding acquired asset. We record operating-related incentives as a reduction to expense in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the expenditure for which the incentive is intended to compensate.Fair ValueWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, certain other receivables, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: ▪Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.▪Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.▪Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help confirm that the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset and liability classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, non-binding broker quotes, and probability-weighted outcomes that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data.Equity InvestmentsWe regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows: ▪Marketable equity investments are equity securities with RDFV that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement. ▪Non-marketable equity investments are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes.▪Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss. Realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments is adjusted for qualifying observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. Non-marketable equity investments and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements64Table of Contents▪Non-marketable equity investments are tested for impairment using a qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and property, plant, and equipment. Upon determining that an impairment may exist, the security's fair value is calculated and compared to its carrying value, and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.▪Equity method investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews using the other-than-temporary impairment model, which considers the severity and duration of a decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.Derivative Financial InstrumentsOur primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. For presentation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments, including related collateral amounts, are presented at fair value on a gross basis and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities.Cash flow hedges use foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards and currency swaps, to hedge exposures for variability in the US-dollar equivalent of non-US-dollar-denominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital purchases spending.The after-tax gains or losses from the effective portion of a cash flow hedge are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the impact of the hedge transaction. For foreign currency contracts hedging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, and are recognized in earnings in the same income statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the cash flow hedge transactions become improbable, the corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be immediately reclassified to interest and other, net. Cash flows associated with these derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item.Fair value hedges use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the offsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other, net. Cash flows associated with these derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within net cash provided by (used for) financing activities.Non-designated hedges use foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, and non-US-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as hedged investments. We also use interest rate contracts to hedge interest rate risk related to our US-dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt investments classified as hedged investments. The change in fair value of non-designated derivatives is recorded through earnings in the line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations to which the derivatives most closely relate, primarily in interest and other, net. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives. Debt InvestmentsDebt investments include investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. Unhedged debt investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalents. Unhedged debt investments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and all economically hedged debt investments are classified as short-term investments, as they represent the investment of cash available for current operations. For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument, or the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net. Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We determine the cost of the investment sold at the individual security level and record the interest income and realized gains or losses on the sale of these investments in interest and other, net. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements65Table of ContentsUnhedged debt investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews. For investments in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists by considering information about the collectability of the instrument, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. We recognize an allowance for credit losses, up to the amount of the unrealized loss when appropriate, and write down the amortized cost basis of the investment if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in interest and other, net, and unrealized losses not related to credit losses are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, reverse repurchase agreements, and trade and other receivables. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty's relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy, substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December 28, 2024, our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding money market funds invested in US treasury and US agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed $1.4 billion. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our derivative counterparties and obtain and secure collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions when we deem it appropriate. Cash collateral exchanged under our collateral security arrangements is included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. For reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability unless the collateral is repledged.A substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to OEMs and ODMs. We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. We believe the net accounts receivable balances from our three largest customers (47% as of December 28, 2024) do not represent a significant credit risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.Variable Interest EntitiesWe have economic interests in entities that are VIEs. If we conclude we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we are required to consolidate the entity in our financial statements. To determine if we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide services to the VIE. Periodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.Non-Controlling InterestsOur Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of majority-owned subsidiaries consolidated under the variable interest and voting interest models. Non-controlling interests represent the portion of equity not attributable to Intel and are reported as a separate component of equity, net of tax and transaction costs, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for majority-owned subsidiaries are attributed to Intel and to non-controlling interest holders on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) based on respective ownership percentages. We account for changes in ownership of our majority-owned subsidiaries as equity transactions when we retain a controlling financial interest. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements66Table of ContentsBusiness CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments in determining the fair value of the following:▪inventory; property, plant, and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; and contingent consideration; each as may be applicable; ▪intangible assets, including the valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, and our assumed market segment share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;▪deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date; and▪goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies. These assumptions and estimates are used to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and to allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we may recognize adjustments to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and related goodwill.Employee Equity Incentive PlansWe use the straight-line amortization method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the service period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of RSUs, we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award.For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.Income TaxesWe compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is affected by management's plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, such changes could also affect our future provision for taxes.We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for (benefit from) taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.We recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in US taxable income as a period cost. We have recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-US earnings or for outside basis differences in our subsidiaries, because we do not plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis differences. Remittances of non-US earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-US and US operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-US earnings, which could be subject to applicable non-US income and withholding taxes. LeasesLeases consist of real property and machinery and equipment. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. For leases for supplier capacity, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. For all other leases, we account for the lease and non-lease components separately and do not include the non-lease components in our leased assets and corresponding liabilities. Payments on leases may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are based on output of the underlying leased assets. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements67Table of ContentsLoss ContingenciesWe are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims, liabilities related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business and are subject to change, including due to sudden or rapid developments in proceedings or claims. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously accrued liabilities, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Note 3 : Operating SegmentsWe previously announced the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024, and creates a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCAI, and NEX) and our Intel Foundry business. Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and related solutions for external customers. Intel Foundry consists substantially of process engineering, manufacturing, and foundry services groups that provide manufacturing, test, and assembly services to our Intel Products business and to external customers. Both businesses utilize marketing, sales, and other support functions. Our internal foundry model is a key component of our strategy and is designed to reshape our operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. We also previously announced our intent to operate Altera as a standalone business. Altera was previously included in our DCAI segment results and, beginning in the first quarter of 2024, is included in \"all other.\" As a result of these changes, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. All prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODMs internally receive information and manage and monitor our operating segment performance. There are no changes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for any prior periods.We organize our business as follows:▪Intel Products:▪Client Computing Group (CCG)▪Data Center and AI (DCAI)▪Network and Edge (NEX)▪Intel Foundry▪All other:▪Altera▪Mobileye▪OtherCCG, DCAI, and Intel Foundry qualify as reportable operating segments. NEX, Altera, and Mobileye do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose certain of their results. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment. The accounting policies applied to our segments follow those applied to Intel as a whole. A summary of the basis for which we report our operating segment revenues and operating margin is as follows: Intel Products: CCG, DCAI, and NEX▪Segment revenue: Consists of revenues from external customers. Our Intel Products operating segments represent most of Intel consolidated revenue and are derived from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture. ▪Segment expenses: Consists of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, external foundry and other manufacturing expenses, product development costs, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements68Table of ContentsIntel Foundry ▪Segment revenue: Consists substantially of intersegment product and services revenue for wafer fabrication, substrates and other related products, and services sold to Intel Products, Altera, and certain other Intel internal businesses. We recognize intersegment revenue based on the completion of performance obligations. Product revenue is recognized upon transfer of ownership, which is generally at the completion of wafer sorting. Backend service revenue is recognized upon the completion of assembly and test milestones, which approximates the recognition of revenue over the service period. Intersegment sales are recorded at prices that are intended to approximate market pricing. Intel Foundry also includes certain third-party foundry and assembly and test revenue from external customers that totaled $385 million in 2024, $953 million in 2023, and $474 million in 2022. ▪Segment expenses: Consists of direct expenses for technology development, product manufacturing and services provided by Intel Foundry to internal and external customers, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses. Direct expenses for product manufacturing include excess capacity charges.All OtherOur \"all other\" category includes the results of operations from other non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, including our Altera and Mobileye businesses, start-up businesses that support our initiatives, and historical results of operations from divested businesses. The financial results of our all other category include intersegment product and services revenue and intersegment expenses.We allocate operating expenses from our sales and marketing group to the Intel Products operating segments and allocate operating expenses from our finance and administration groups to all of our operating segments, except Mobileye. We estimate that the substantial majority of our consolidated depreciation expense was incurred by Intel Foundry in 2024, 2023, and 2022. Intel Foundry depreciation expense is substantially included in overhead cost pools and then combined with other costs, and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through the manufacturing process and is sold to Intel Products or other customers. As a result, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each Intel Products operating segment's operating income (loss). We do not allocate to our operating segments corporate operating expenses that primarily consist of:▪restructuring and other charges; ▪share-based compensation; ▪certain impairment charges; and▪certain acquisition-related adjustments, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. We do not allocate to our operating segments non-operating items such as:▪gains and losses from equity investments;▪interest and other income; and▪income taxes. Our interim Co-Chief Executive Officers are our CODMs. The CODMs primarily use operating income (loss) to evaluate each segment's performance and allocate resources. This measure is utilized during our budgeting and forecasting process to assess profitability and enable decision making regarding strategic initiatives, capital investments, and personnel across all operating segments. While operating income (loss) is the primary measure used by our CODMs to allocate resources, they often review materials that present operating segment gross margin. Accordingly, we have included gross margin as a secondary measure within the accompanying reconciliation of our operating segment and consolidated results. The measures regularly provided to and used by our CODMs under our new operating model continue to evolve; currently, our CODMs do not regularly review or receive discrete asset information by operating segment.Intersegment eliminations: Intersegment sales and related gross margin on inventory recorded at the end of the period or sold through to third-party customers is eliminated for consolidation purposes. The Intel Products operating segments and Intel Foundry are meant to reflect separate fabless semiconductor and foundry companies, respectively. Thus, certain intersegment activity is captured within the intersegment eliminations upon consolidation and presented at the Intel consolidated level. This activity primarily relates to inventory reserves, which are determined and recorded based on our accounting policies for Intel as a whole, but are only recorded by the Intel Products operating segments upon transfer of inventory from Intel Foundry. If a reserve is identified that relates to neither Intel Products operating segments nor Intel Foundry, the reserve is recognized as activity within the intersegment eliminations for Intel on a consolidated basis. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements69Table of ContentsNet revenue, cost of sales, gross margin, operating expenses, and operating income (loss) for each period were as follows:(In Millions)Dec 28, 2024Intel ProductsCCGDCAINEXTotal Intel ProductsIntel FoundryAll OtherCorporate UnallocatedIntersegment EliminationsTotal ConsolidatedRevenue$30,290 $12,817 $5,842 $48,949 $17,543 $3,824 $— $(17,215)$53,101 Cost of sales14,569 6,792 2,457 23,818 25,596 1,831 1,919 (17,408)35,756 Gross margin (loss)15,721 6,025 3,385 25,131 (8,053)1,993 (1,919)193 17,345 Operating expenses4,801 4,687 2,454 11,942 5,355 2,077 9,299 350 29,023 Operating income (loss)$10,920 $1,338 $931 $13,189 $(13,408)$(84)$(11,218)$(157)$(11,678)(In Millions)Dec 30, 2023Intel ProductsCCGDCAINEXTotal Intel ProductsIntel FoundryAll OtherCorporate UnallocatedIntersegment EliminationsTotal ConsolidatedRevenue$29,258 $12,635 $5,774 $47,667 $18,910 $5,608 $— $(17,957)$54,228 Cost of sales14,606 6,420 3,095 24,121 21,471 2,475 2,136 (17,686)32,517 Gross margin (loss)14,652 6,215 2,679 23,546 (2,561)3,133 (2,136)(271)21,711 Operating expenses5,139 4,595 2,475 12,209 4,394 2,054 3,029 (68)21,618 Operating income (loss)$9,513 $1,620 $204 $11,337 $(6,955)$1,079 $(5,165)$(203)$93 (In Millions)Dec 31, 2022Intel ProductsCCGDCAINEXTotal Intel ProductsIntel FoundryAll OtherCorporate UnallocatedIntersegment EliminationsTotal ConsolidatedRevenue$31,773 $16,856 $8,409 $57,038 $27,491 $5,530 $— $(27,005)$63,054 Cost of sales16,826 7,081 3,856 27,763 28,052 2,425 2,875 (24,927)36,188 Gross margin (loss)14,947 9,775 4,553 29,275 (561)3,105 (2,875)(2,078)26,866 Operating expenses6,740 5,577 3,021 15,338 4,608 1,931 2,758 (103)24,532 Operating income (loss)$8,207 $4,198 $1,532 $13,937 $(5,169)$1,174 $(5,633)$(1,975)$2,334  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements70Table of ContentsCorporate Unallocated ExpensesCorporate unallocated expenses include certain operating and non-operating costs not allocated to specific operating segments.

(Apollo) involving the sale of 49% of our interest in an Irish limited liability company (Ireland SCIP) for net proceeds of $11.0 billion, which increased our capital in excess of par value. Ireland SCIP is a VIE that we consolidate into our Consolidated Financial Statements because we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, distributions will be received from Ireland SCIP based on both parties' proportional ownership. Ireland SCIP has the rights to operate Fab 34 in Leixlip, Ireland, and has the rights to the related factory output. We have the right to purchase 100% of the related factory output from Ireland SCIP. We will retain sole ownership of Fab 34, will be engaged as the Fab 34 operator in exchange for variable payments from Ireland SCIP based on the related factory output, and will be required to maintain certain performance standards in our capacity as operator. We are required to substantially complete construction of Fab 34 in accordance with contractual parameters and timelines or we will be required to pay delay-related liquidated damages to Apollo beginning in 2026, not to exceed $1.1 billion in total. As of December 28, 2024, we expect certain construction milestones for Fab 34 will be delayed as we refined our near-term production capacity requirements and related capital outlays relative to those that are required per the Ireland SCIP agreement. As a result, in 2024 we recognized a loss of $755 million within Interest and other, net from the change in fair value of the liquidated damage provisions, which qualify as a non-designated derivative. Refer to \"Note 16: Derivative Financial Instruments\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Though we expect certain construction delays in the near term, we intend to complete construction of Fab 34. We will be required to purchase minimum quantities of the related factory output from Ireland SCIP, or we will be subject to pay certain volume-related damages to Ireland SCIP, beginning at the earlier of when construction is complete or Q3 2027.As of December 28, 2024, other than cash and cash equivalents held by Ireland SCIP, substantially all of the remaining assets and liabilities of Ireland SCIP were eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.Arizona SCIP We consolidate the results of an Arizona limited liability company (Arizona SCIP), a VIE, into our Consolidated Financial Statements because we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, contributions will be made to, and distributions will be received from Arizona SCIP based on Intel's and Brookfield Asset Management's (Brookfield's) proportional ownership. We will be the sole operator and main beneficiary of two new chip factories that will be constructed by Arizona SCIP, and we will have the right to purchase 100% of the related factory output. Once production commences, we will be required to both operate Arizona SCIP at minimum production levels (measured in wafer starts per week) and limit excess inventory held on site or we will be subject to certain damages.We have an unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of Arizona SCIP. The total construction costs were estimated at $29.0 billion when we entered into the definitive agreement with Brookfield in 2022.As of December 28, 2024, substantially all of the assets of Arizona SCIP consisted of property, plant, and equipment. The remaining assets and liabilities of Arizona SCIP were eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The assets held by Arizona SCIP, which can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE and are not available to us, were $11.5 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($4.8 billion as of December 30, 2023). MobileyeIn 2022, Mobileye completed its IPO and certain other equity financing transactions. During 2023, we converted 38.5 million of our Mobileye Class B shares into Class A shares, representing 5% of Mobileye's outstanding capital stock, and subsequently sold the Class A shares for $42 per share as part of a secondary offering, receiving net proceeds of $1.6 billion and increasing our capital in excess of par value by $663 million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of Mobileye into our Consolidated Financial Statements. In the third quarter of 2024, the non-cash impairment of goodwill related to our Mobileye reporting unit was attributed to Intel and to non-controlling interest holders based on our proportional ownership (see \"Note 11: Goodwill\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). IMS Nanofabrication In 2023, we closed agreements to sell a combined 32% minority stake in our IMS business, a business within our Intel Foundry operating segment—including a 20% stake to Bain Capital Special Situations and a 10% stake to TSMC. Net proceeds resulting from the minority stake sales totaled $1.4 billion, and our capital in excess of par value increased by $958 million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of IMS into our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements73Table of ContentsNote 5 : Earnings (Loss) Per ShareWe computed basic earnings (loss) per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We computed diluted earnings (loss) per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period, if applicable.Years Ended (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)Dec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Net income (loss)$(19,233)$1,675 $8,017 Less: net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests(477)(14)3 Net income (loss) attributable to Intel$(18,756)$1,689 $8,014 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding—basic4,280 4,190 4,108 Dilutive effect of employee equity incentive plans— 22 15 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding—diluted4,280 4,212 4,123 Earnings (loss) per share attributable to Intel—basic$(4.38)$0.40 $1.95 Earnings (loss) per share attributable to Intel—diluted$(4.38)$0.40 $1.94 Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. The potentially dilutive impact from the assumed issuance of common stock associated with a contractual conversion feature is determined by applying the if-converted method to the assumed exercise of the outstanding conversion feature.At December 28, 2024, the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan, and the assumed issuance of common stock associated with a contractual conversion feature, as applicable, had an anti-dilutive effect on diluted loss per share and were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share. At December 28, 2024, 114 million anti-dilutive shares (70 million in 2022) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share. In 2023, securities that would have been anti-dilutive were insignificant.Note 6 : Other Financial Statement DetailsAccounts ReceivableWe sell certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. We record these transactions as sales of receivables and present cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Accounts receivable sold under non-recourse factoring arrangements were $2.3 billion during 2024, $2.0 billion during 2023, and $665 million during 2022. After the sale of our accounts receivable, we expect to collect payment from the customers and remit it to the third-party financial institution.InventoriesYears Ended (In Millions)Dec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Raw materials$1,344 $1,166 Work in process7,432 6,203 Finished goods3,422 3,758 Total inventories$12,198 $11,127  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements74Table of ContentsProperty, Plant, and EquipmentYears Ended (In Millions)Dec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Land and buildings$56,544 $51,182 Machinery and equipment103,150 100,033 Construction in progress50,418 43,442 Total property, plant, and equipment, gross210,112 194,657 Less: Accumulated depreciation(102,193)(98,010)Total property, plant, and equipment, net$107,919 $96,647 Our depreciable property, plant, and equipment assets are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 3 to 8 years; and buildings, 10 to 25 years. We invest in and deploy manufacturing assets in response to manufacturing capacity requirements based upon short- and long-term demand forecasts and economic returns relative to capital outlays. We regularly monitor, evaluate, and adjust our manufacturing capacity footprint in response to a number of volatile factors that impact our business, including demand for our products and services and the state of the semiconductor industry as a whole. In connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements for the third quarter of 2024, we evaluated our current process technology node capacities relative to projected market demand for our products and services, and concluded that our manufacturing asset portfolio, primarily for our Intel 7 process node, exceeded manufacturing capacity requirements. Upon performing a re-use assessment, we impaired and accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets. In total, we recorded non-cash impairments and accelerated depreciation charges of $2.3 billion and $992 million, respectively, in 2024, substantially all of which were recognized in cost of sales within our Intel Foundry operating segment. We also incurred certain other non-cash asset impairment charges of $442 million as a direct result of the 2024 Restructuring Plan (see \"Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). These charges were included as a component of \"corporate unallocated expenses\" within the restructuring and other category presented in \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We negotiate extended payment terms of greater than 90 days with certain of our capital vendors, which are reported as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows when paid. Unpaid amounts related to the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment in 2024 under such extended payment terms, included in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, totaled $3.2 billion.

These arrangements vary in size, duration, and conditions and allow us to maintain a market-comparable foothold across various geographies. These incentives are primarily structured as cash grants and refundable tax credits. Capital-related incentives have terms of up to 15 years and operating-related incentives have terms that can vary widely. We are eligible to receive these incentives because we engage in qualifying capital investments, R&D, and other activities as defined by the relevant government entities. These include qualifying capital investments for semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging manufacturing facilities construction and acquisition of equipment. Each incentive requires that we comply with certain conditions for a period that may exceed the incentive terms. These conditions can include achievement of future operational targets and committing to minimum levels of capital investment. If conditions are not satisfied, the incentives may be subject to reduction, recapture, or termination. For example, in November 2024 we entered into a direct funding agreement with the US Department of Commerce under the CHIPS Act that contains detailed milestones we must achieve for us to receive the funds, including the achievement of various milestones with respect to capital expenditures, facility completion, process technology development, wafer production, Intel products insourcing, and external foundry customer acquisitions. It also contains restrictions on certain “change of control” transactions we are permitted to engage in, a requirement that we share with the US government project economic returns above specified thresholds, and various termination rights and remedies if we were to breach the agreement, including potential repayment of some or all of the awards.Capital-related incentives reduced gross property, plant, and equipment by $9.5 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($5.5 billion as of December 30, 2023), of which $4.1 billion was recognized in 2024 ($2.2 billion in 2023). Capital-related incentives reduced depreciation expense by $594 million in 2024, of which the substantial majority reduced cost of sales ($226 million in 2023, substantially all of which reduced cost of sales, and $230 million in 2022, all of which reduced cost of sales). Of our total capital-related government incentives recognized in 2024, $3.3 billion was recognized as a non-cash investing activity ($1.1 billion in 2023 and $128 million in 2022). Related incentives recognized during each period consisted of the following:▪US federal government pursuant to the CHIPS Act. In September 2024, we were awarded up to $3.0 billion in direct funding for the Secure Enclave program to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the US government. In November 2024, we signed a Direct Funding Agreement with the US Department of Commerce for the award of $7.9 billion in government incentives. We recognized $1.3 billion of grants, including $253 million of operating grants, in 2024 under the CHIPS Act. Additionally, we recognized an advanced manufacturing investment tax credit of $2.6 billion in 2024 ($845 million in 2023), which may be refunded to us in cash to the extent it exceeds our outstanding income tax liabilities.▪US state governments. We recognized $115 million of grants in 2024 related to modernization and expansion of chip factories in Oregon ($723 million in 2023 related to two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio).▪Non-US governments. We recognized $384 million of grants and refundable tax credits in 2024 ($645 million in 2023), substantially all and a majority of which, respectively, related to the expansion of silicon wafer manufacturing facilities in Ireland.Operating-related incentives, including those recognized under the CHIPS Act, benefited operating income by $442 million in 2024, the substantial majority of which was recorded in cost of sales ($202 million in 2023 and $104 million in 2022, a majority of which was recorded in cost of sales in both periods).

Restructuring charges are primarily composed of employee severance and benefit arrangements, non-cash charges related to asset impairments associated with exit activities, and charges relating to real estate exits and consolidations. These charges were included as \"corporate unallocated expenses\" within the restructuring and other category presented in \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to recognize total charges of approximately $3.0 billion under the 2024 Restructuring Plan. The cumulative cost of the 2024 Restructuring Plan as of December 28, 2024, was $2.8 billion. Any changes to our estimates or timing will be reflected in our results of operations in future periods. We expect actions pursuant to the 2024 Restructuring Plan to be substantially complete by the fourth quarter of 2025, which is subject to change.Employee severance and benefit arrangements includes net charges relating to the 2024 Restructuring Plan of $2.2 billion in 2024. Charges relating to other actions taken to streamline operations and to reduce costs were $294 million in 2024. Charges accrued as of December 28, 2024, were recorded as current liabilities within accrued compensation and benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Charges in 2023 and 2022 primarily related to the 2022 Restructuring Program, which was approved to rebalance our workforce and operations in alignment with our strategy and was completed in the first quarter of 2024. The cumulative cost of the 2022 Restructuring Program as of December 28, 2024 was $1.3 billion.Restructuring activities related to employee severance and benefit arrangements under the 2024 and 2022 Restructuring Plans were as follows:(In Millions)2024 Restructuring Plan2022 Restructuring ProgramAccrued balance as of December 25, 2021$— $— Accruals and adjustments— 1,038 Cash payments— (165)Accrued balance as of December 31, 2022— 873 Accruals and adjustments— 222 Cash payments— (1,013)Accrued balance as of December 30, 2023— 82 Accruals and adjustments2,306 — Cash payments(2,004)(82)Accrued balance as of December 28, 2024$302 $—  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements77Table of ContentsLitigation charges and other includes a charge of $780 million in 2024 arising out of the R2 litigation. In 2023, a $1.2 billion benefit was recorded due to the reduction in the previously accrued charge as a result of developments in the VLSI litigation. 2023 charges also included a $401 million charge for an EC-imposed fine and a $353 million termination fee in connection with our inability to timely obtain required regulatory approvals needed to acquire Tower. In 2009, we recorded and paid an EC-imposed fine that was subsequently annulled, which resulted in a benefit of $1.2 billion in 2022. Refer to \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about litigation related items. Asset impairment charges in 2024 includes non-cash charges associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan, including $442 million of non-cash impairments of construction-in-progress assets associated with our decision to exit and outsource manufacturing capabilities for certain internal test hardware; and $103 million of non-cash impairments of operating leased assets and related leasehold improvements resulting from real estate consolidations and exits. Real estate consolidations and exits did not significantly change our operating lease liabilities and may result in future cash outlays for facility restoration or the relocation of operations. These impairments were recorded within property, plant, and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, except for the impairment of operating leased assets of $83 million that were recorded within other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 28, 2024.In addition, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $3.0 billion in 2024 (see \"Note 11: Goodwill\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Further, as a result of a decline in the actual and projected undiscounted cash flows for certain acquired intangible assets, we concluded the assets were not recoverable and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $108 million in 2024.

We assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets quarterly, weighing available positive and negative evidence. As a result of our assessment in the third quarter of 2024, we determined it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recoverable based upon our three-year cumulative historical loss position as of the third quarter of 2024, largely resulting from the asset impairment and restructuring and other charges incurred during 2024. Additionally, our 2024 provision for taxes and 2023 benefit from taxes included R&D tax credits, which provide a tax benefit based on our eligible R&D spending and are not dependent on lower income before taxes.Our effective tax rate decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by our R&D tax credits and a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US jurisdictions.We derive the effective tax rate benefit, or detriment, attributed to non-US income taxed at different rates primarily from our operations in Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, and Malaysia. The statutory tax rates in these jurisdictions range from 12.5% to 24.0%. We are subject to reduced tax rates in Israel and Malaysia as long as we conduct certain eligible activities and make certain capital investments. We have conditional reduced tax rates that expire at various dates through 2056, and we expect to apply for renewals upon expiration, if available. In 2024 the tax benefit specifically attributable to tax holidays was $67 million ($129 million in 2023 and $220 million in 2022) with a $0.02 impact on diluted earnings per share ($0.03 in 2023 and $0.05 in 2022). Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements79Table of ContentsDeferred and Current Income TaxesDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes.

As of December 28, 2024, our federal and non-US net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $279 million and $2.7 billion, respectively. The majority of the federal and non-US net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining federal and non-US net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2040. As of December 28, 2024, we have undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $21.0 billion that we have indefinitely invested, and on which we have not recognized deferred taxes. Estimating the amount of potential tax is not practicable because of the complexity and variety of assumptions necessary to compute the tax.Current income taxes receivable of $2.6 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($59 million as of December 30, 2023) are included in other current assets. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements80Table of ContentsLong-term income taxes payable of $1.6 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($2.6 billion as of December 30, 2023) are primarily composed of the transition tax from Tax Reform, which is payable over eight years beginning in 2018, as well as amounts for uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated deduction for state taxes and non-US tax credits.Uncertain Tax PositionsYears Ended (In Millions)Dec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Beginning gross unrecognized tax benefits$1,124 $1,229 $1,020 Settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities (59)(288)(18)Changes in balances related to tax position taken during prior periods(8)— (120)Changes in balances related to tax position taken during current period73 183347Ending gross unrecognized tax benefits$1,130 $1,124 $1,229 If the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $946 million as of December 28, 2024 ($962 million as of December 30, 2023) and a reduction in the effective tax rate. Interest, penalties, and accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in the periods presented.We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain US federal and non-US tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 28, 2024, could decrease by as much as $314 million in the next 12 months. We file federal, state, and non-US tax returns. We are no longer subject to US federal and non-US tax examinations for years prior to 2018 and 2015, respectively. For US state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2015.Note 9 : InvestmentsShort-term InvestmentsShort-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments, and are recorded within cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bills and bonds and US agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, substantially all time deposits were issued by institutions outside the US. The fair value of our economically hedged marketable debt investments was $13.5 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($17.1 billion as of December 30, 2023). For hedged investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net losses of $464 million in 2024 (net gains of $534 million in 2023 and net losses of $748 million in 2022). Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The adjusted cost of our unhedged investments was $5.2 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($4.7 billion as of December 30, 2023), which approximated the fair value for these periods.The fair value of marketable debt investments, by contractual maturity, as of December 28, 2024, was as follows:(In Millions)Fair ValueDue in 1 year or less$5,690 Due in 1–2 years2,321 Due in 2–5 years6,182 Due after 5 years168 Instruments not due at a single maturity date14,316 Total$18,677 1    Instruments not due at a single maturity date is composed of money market fund deposits, which are classified as either short-term investments or cash and cash equivalents. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements81Table of Contents Equity InvestmentsYears Ended (In Millions)Dec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Marketable equity investments1$848 $1,194 Non-marketable equity investments4,535 4,635 Total$5,383 $5,829 1    Most of our marketable equity investments are subject to trading-volume or market-based restrictions, which limit the number of shares we may sell in a specified period of time, impacting our ability to liquidate these investments.

We have a receivable within other current assets for the transaction's remaining proceeds of $2.0 billion, which remains outstanding as of December 28, 2024 and will be received upon the second closing of the transaction, expected to be in March 2025.In connection with the transaction, we have a wafer manufacturing and sale agreement that includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of the NAND OpCo Business. These incentives and penalties present a maximum exposure of up to $500 million annually, and $1.5 billion in the aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update the operating plan of the NAND OpCo Business, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and penalties and our expectations of the performance of the NAND OpCo Business against those metrics.We were reimbursed for costs that we incurred on behalf of the NAND OpCo Business for corporate function services, which include human resources, information technology, finance, supply chain, and other compliance requirements. We recorded a receivable due from the NAND OpCo Business, a deconsolidated entity, of $98 million within other current assets as of December 28, 2024 ($145 million recorded as of December 30, 2023). Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements82Table of ContentsNote 11 : Goodwill(In Millions)Dec 30, 2023AcquisitionsTransfersImpairmentsDec 28, 2024Client Computing$4,749 $— $(130)$— $4,619 Data Center and AI8,721 — (777)— 7,944 Network and Edge2,809 — (29)— 2,780 Intel Foundry— — 222 (222)— Mobileye10,919 — — (2,613)8,306 Altera— — 781 — 781 All Other 393 86 (67)(149)263 Total$27,591 $86 $— $(2,984)$24,693 (In Millions)Dec 31, 2022AcquisitionsTransfersOtherDec 30, 2023Client Computing$4,254 $— $495 $— $4,749 Data Center and AI9,013 — (292)— 8,721 Network and Edge2,809 — — — 2,809 Mobileye10,919 —— — 10,919 Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics596 —(596)— — All other— — 393 — 393 Total$27,591 $— $— $— $27,591 Our quarterly qualitative impairment assessment for the third quarter of 2024 indicated that a more detailed quantitative analysis was necessary for certain of our reporting units, primarily due to the decline in our market capitalization below the carrying value of our net assets, as well as the decline in our Mobileye reporting unit's market capitalization below the carrying value of Mobileye's net assets. Our quantitative assessment was performed by measuring each reporting unit's fair value using the income approach, the market approach, or a combination of both. When using the income approach, we tested the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. As a result of our impairment tests, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024 within restructuring and other, most of which related to our Mobileye reporting unit, as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was lower than the assigned carrying value. The process of valuing each reporting unit is inherently subjective as valuation models require the application of significant estimates and the use of unobservable inputs, including market segment share, projected financial information, and discount rates. No impairment was required for our other reporting units, even when considering a hypothetical increase in the discount rate of 1%, which would cause a significant decrease in the estimated fair value of the respective non-impaired reporting units. Finally, to corroborate our estimated fair value, we performed a market capitalization reconciliation as of September 28, 2024, concluding that the implied control premium was reasonable. The accumulated impairment loss as of December 28, 2024 was $3.9 billion: $2.6 billion associated with Mobileye, $364 million associated with CCG, $275 million associated with DCAI, $79 million associated with NEX, and the remainder associated with other reporting units.In the first quarter of 2024, as a result of modifying our segment reporting, we reallocated goodwill among our affected reporting units on a relative fair value basis. We performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each of our reporting units immediately before and after our business reorganization. We concluded, based on our pre-reorganization impairment test, that goodwill was not impaired. As a result of our post-reorganization impairment test, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $222 million within restructuring and other in the first quarter of 2024 related to our Intel Foundry reporting unit, as the estimated fair value of the new reporting unit was lower than the assigned carrying value, which includes substantially all of our allocated property, plant, and equipment. The Intel Foundry reporting unit has no remaining goodwill. At the conclusion of our impairment assessment performed during the first quarter of 2024, the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for all remaining reporting units. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements83Table of ContentsNote 12 : Identified Intangible AssetsDecember 28, 2024December 30, 2023(In Millions)Gross AssetsAccumulated AmortizationNetGross AssetsAccumulated AmortizationNetDeveloped technology$8,007 $(6,445)$1,562 $10,520 $(7,996)$2,524 Customer relationships and brands1,907 (1,372)535 1,986 (1,286)700 Licensed technology and patents3,387 (1,852)1,535 3,088 (1,728)1,360 Internal-use software128 (73)55 — — — Other non-amortizing intangibles4 — 4 5 — 5 Total identified intangible assets$13,433 $(9,742)$3,691 $15,599 $(11,010)$4,589 During 2024 and 2023, we entered into and/or renewed several licensed technology arrangements totaling $562 million and $309 million respectively, which are subject to amortization.Amortization expenses recorded for and the weighted average useful life assigned to identified intangible assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions)LocationDec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Weighted Average Useful Life1Developed technologyCost of sales$879 $1,235 $1,341 9 yearsCustomer relationships and brandsMarketing, general, and administrative165 172 185 12 yearsLicensed technology and patentsCost of sales360 348 381 12 yearsInternal-use softwareMarketing, general, and administrative24 — — 5 yearsTotal amortization expenses$1,428 $1,755 $1,907 1  Represents weighted average useful life in years of intangible assets as of December 28, 2024.

If an observable price adjustment or impairment is recognized on our non-marketable equity investments during the period, we classify these assets as Level 3. Similarly, impairments recognized on our goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant, and equipment are categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, as we utilize unobservable inputs such as prospective financial information, market segment growth rates, and discount rates in the fair value measurement process.Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisFinancial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity investments and equity method investments that have not been remeasured or impaired in the current period, grants receivable, certain other receivables, and issued debt. We classify the fair value of grants receivable as Level 2. The estimated fair value of these financial assets approximates their carrying value. The aggregate carrying value of grants receivable as of December 28, 2024 was $1.7 billion (the aggregate carrying value of grants receivable as of December 30, 2023 was $559 million). We classify the fair value of issued debt (excluding commercial paper) as Level 2. The fair value of these instruments was $43.5 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($47.6 billion as of December 30, 2023).  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements87Table of ContentsNote 15 : Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component and related tax effects for each period were as follows: (In Millions)Unrealized Holding Gains (Losses) on DerivativesActuarial Valuation and Other Pension Expenses Translation Adjustments and Other TotalBalance as of December 25, 2021 $211 $(1,114)$23 $(880)Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications(910)923 (28)(15)Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss410 82 (6)486 Tax effects(10)(150)7 (153)Other comprehensive income (loss)(510)855 (27)318 Balance as of December 31, 2022(299)(259)(4)(562)Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications3 57 11 71 Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss328 33 — 361 Tax effects(59)(24)(2)(85)Other comprehensive income (loss)272 66 9 347 Balance as of December 30, 2023(27)(193)5 (215)Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications(652)54 (4)(602)Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss96 11 2 109 Tax effects1 (5)1 (3)Other comprehensive income (loss)(555)60 (1)(496)Balance as of December 28, 2024$(582)$(133)$4 $(711)Note 16 : Derivative Financial InstrumentsVolume of Derivative ActivityThe total gross notional amounts for outstanding derivatives (recorded at fair value) at the end of each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Foreign currency contracts$25,472 $30,064 $31,603 Interest rate contracts17,899 18,363 16,011 Other2,593 2,103 2,094 Total$45,964 $50,530 $49,708 The total notional amount of outstanding pay-variable, receive-fixed interest rate swaps was $12.0 billion as of December 28, 2024 and as of December 30, 2023.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements88Table of ContentsFair Value of Derivative Instruments in the Consolidated Balance SheetsDecember 28, 2024December 30, 2023(In Millions)Assets1Liabilities2Assets1Liabilities2Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:Foreign currency contracts3$40 $405 $255 $142 Interest rate contracts— 582 — 578 Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments40 987 255 720 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:Foreign currency contracts3510 100 314 363 Interest rate contracts184 25 261 36 Equity contracts348 — 366 — Other4— 755 — — Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments1,042 880 941 399 Total derivatives$1,082 $1,867 $1,196 $1,119 1Derivative assets are recorded as other assets, current and long-term.2Derivative liabilities are recorded as other liabilities, current and long-term.3A substantial majority of these instruments mature within 12 months.4Embedded derivative related to our Ireland SCIP arrangement.Amounts Offset in the Consolidated Balance SheetsAgreements subject to master netting arrangements with various counterparties, and cash and non-cash collateral posted under such agreements at the end of each period were as follows:December 28, 2024Gross Amounts Not Offset in the Balance Sheet(In Millions)Gross Amounts RecognizedGross Amounts Offset in the Balance SheetNet Amounts Presented in the Balance SheetFinancial InstrumentsCash and Non-Cash Collateral Received or PledgedNet AmountAssets:Derivative assets subject to master netting arrangements$948 $— $948 $(269)$(679)$— Reverse repurchase agreements2,654 — 2,654 — (2,654)— Total assets$3,602 $— $3,602 $(269)$(3,333)$— Liabilities:Derivative liabilities subject to master netting arrangements1,084 — 1,084 (269)(745)70 Total liabilities$1,084 $— $1,084 $(269)$(745)$70  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements89Table of ContentsDecember 30, 2023Gross Amounts Not Offset in the Balance Sheet(In Millions)Gross Amounts RecognizedGross Amounts Offset in the Balance SheetNet Amounts Presented in the Balance SheetFinancial InstrumentsCash and Non-Cash Collateral Received or PledgedNet AmountAssets:Derivative assets subject to master netting arrangements$1,047 $— $1,047 $(617)$(430)$— Reverse repurchase agreements2,554 — 2,554 — (2,554)— Total assets$3,601 $— $3,601 $(617)$(2,984)$— Liabilities:Derivative liabilities subject to master netting arrangements1,111 — 1,111 (617)(399)95 Total liabilities$1,111 $— $1,111 $(617)$(399)$95 We obtain and secure available collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions and reverse repurchase agreements, when we deem it appropriate.Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging RelationshipsThe before-tax net gains or losses attributed to the effective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) were $652 million net losses in 2024 ($3 million net gains in 2023 and $910 million net losses in 2022).

We will periodically reassess the probability of paying such liquidated damages and recognize changes in the fair value of the underlying liability through Interest and other, net.Note 17 : Retirement Benefit PlansDefined Contribution PlansWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the US and certain other countries. The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. For the benefit of eligible US employees, we also provide an unfunded non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees, which had a balance of $3.3 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($2.9 billion as of December 30, 2023), recorded within other accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.We expensed $541 million in 2024, $272 million in 2023, and $489 million in 2022 for matching contributions based on the amount of employee contributions under the US qualified defined contribution and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. The matching contribution in the US qualified defined contribution plan was increased from January 1 through December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023 and 2022. The matching contribution in the US qualified defined contribution plan was reduced from March 1 through December 30, 2023 as compared to 2022. US Retiree Medical PlanUpon retirement, we provide certain benefits to eligible US employees who were hired prior to 2014 under the US Retiree Medical Plan. The benefits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase eligible coverage in a medical plan.As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the projected benefit obligations were $493 million and $490 million, which used the discount rates of 5.7% and 5.3%. The December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 corresponding fair values of plan assets were $542 million and $548 million. As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the US Retiree Medical Plan was in the net asset position.The investment strategy for US Retiree Medical Plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The assets are invested in tax-aware global equity and fixed-income long credit portfolios. Both portfolios are actively managed by external managers. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries. The tax-aware fixed-income long credit portfolio is composed of domestic securities. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 50% equity and 50% fixed-income investments. As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the majority of the US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. The remaining US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in fixed-income investments and were measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs.As of December 28, 2024, the estimated benefit payments for this plan over the next 10 years are as follows: (In Millions)202520262027202820292030-2034Postretirement medical benefits$37 $45 $45 $44 $44 $209  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements91Table of ContentsPension Benefit PlansWe provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain countries, most significantly Ireland, the US, Germany, and Israel.

Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets for Pension Benefit PlansThe vested benefit obligation for a defined-benefit pension plan is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is currently entitled based on the employee's expected date of separation or retirement.Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Changes in projected benefit obligation:Beginning projected benefit obligation$2,825 $2,705 Service cost33 36 Interest cost122 127 Actuarial (gain) loss(40)57 Currency exchange rate changes(107)38 Plan settlements(143)(103)Other(44)(35)Ending projected benefit obligation12,646 2,825 Changes in fair value of plan assets:Beginning fair value of plan assets2,212 2,130 Actual return on plan assets121 151 Currency exchange rate changes(74)34 Plan settlements(143)(103)Other26 — Ending fair value of plan assets22,142 2,212 Net unfunded status$504 $613 Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance SheetsOther long-term assets$135 $62 Other long-term liabilities$639 $675 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (income), before tax3$337 $410 Accumulated benefit obligation$2,509 $2,706 1    The projected benefit obligation was approximately 30% in the US and 70% outside of the US as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023.2    The fair value of plan assets was approximately 40% in the US and 60% outside of the US as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023.3    The accumulated other comprehensive loss (income), before tax, was approximately 80% in the US and 20% outside of the US as of December 28, 2024 (approximately 70% in the US and 30% outside of the US as of December 30, 2023). Changes in actuarial gains and losses in the projected benefit obligation are generally driven by discount rate movement. We use the corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active plan participants.As of December 28, 2024, the accumulated benefit obligations were $763 million and $1.7 billion for the US plan and non-US plans, respectively. As of December 30, 2023, the accumulated benefit obligations were $849 million and $1.9 billion for the US plan and non-US plans, respectively. As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, only non-US plans had projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements92Table of Contents(In Millions)Dec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Plans with accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assetsAccumulated benefit obligation$850 $1,857 Plan assets$348 $1,301 Plans with projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assetsProjected benefit obligation$987 $1,976 Plan assets$348 $1,301 Assumptions for Pension Benefit PlansYears EndedDec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligationsDiscount rate4.6 %4.5 %Rate of compensation increase3.4 %3.3 %Years Ended202420232022Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine costsDiscount rate4.5 %4.9 %2.2 %Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets5.1 %5.0 %3.2 %Rate of compensation increase3.3 %3.7 %3.2 %We establish the discount rate for each pension plan by analyzing current market long-term bond rates and matching the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension liabilities. We establish the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class.FundingOur practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and regulations. On a worldwide basis, our pension and retiree medical plans were 86% funded as of December 28, 2024. Funded status is not indicative of our ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to fund retirement trusts. Net Periodic Benefit CostThe net periodic benefit cost for pension and US retiree medical benefits was $69 million in 2024 ($107 million in 2023 and $139 million in 2022).

The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 91% fixed income and 9% equity investments. During 2024 and 2023, the US Pension Plan assets were invested in collective investment trust funds, which are measured at net asset value. Non-US Plan AssetsThe investments of the non-US plans are managed by insurance companies, pension funds, or third-party trustees, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have the discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, either through index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and to help enable sufficient pension assets to be available to pay benefits as they come due. The equity investments in the non-US plan assets are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the US, and emerging markets throughout the world. We have control over the investment strategy related to the majority of the assets measured at net asset value, which are invested in hedge funds, bond index funds, and equity index funds. The target allocation of the non-US plan assets that we have control over was approximately 50% fixed income, 35% equity, and 15% hedge fund investments in 2024.Estimated Future Benefit Payments for Pension Benefit PlansAs of December 28, 2024, estimated benefit payments over the next 10 years are as follows:(In Millions)202520262027202820292030-2034Pension benefits$145 $86 $95 $97 $106 $623 Note 18 : Employee Equity Incentive PlansOur equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. Our plans include our 2006 Plan and our 2006 ESPP.Under the 2006 Plan, 1.1 billion shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through June 2026. As of December 28, 2024, 171 million shares of common stock remained available for future grants.Under the 2006 Plan, we may grant RSUs and stock options. We grant RSUs with a service condition as well as RSUs with a market condition, performance condition, and a service condition, which we call PSUs. PSUs are granted to a group of senior officers and employees. For PSUs granted in 2024 and 2023, the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting at the end of the three-year performance period will range from 0% to 200% of the target grant amount. The PSU payout will be determined based on our performance (i) relative to annual targets for each year in the performance period with respect to a revenue growth metric, weighted 60%, and a cash flow from operations metric, weighted 40%, which results are then averaged at the end of the three-year performance period; and (ii) as may be adjusted by two equally weighted modifiers: the TSR of our common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of above median of the S&P 500 Index over a three-year period and revenue CAGR for the three-year performance period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. For 2024 PSUs, overall payout will be capped at the target grant amount if our absolute TSR is negative; additionally, the combined modifiers applied to the payout are capped at +/-25%. As of December 28, 2024, 10 million PSUs were outstanding. PSUs vest three years and one month following the start of the performance period. Other RSU awards and option awards generally vest over four years from the grant date.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements94Table of ContentsShare-Based CompensationShare-based compensation recognized in 2024 was $3.4 billion ($3.2 billion in 2023 and $3.1 billion in 2022). During 2024, the actual tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $684 million ($571 million in 2023 and $478 million in 2022). We realized a related tax expense of $139 million in 2024 for the share-based awards as a result of the shortfall between the tax deduction being less than the associated deferred tax asset for the awards.We estimate the fair value of RSUs and PSUs with a service condition or performance condition using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our shares of common stock prior to vesting. We estimate the fair value of PSUs with a market condition using a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the date of grant using historical volatility. Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock UnitsWeighted average assumptions used in estimating grant values were as follows:Years EndedDec 28, 2024Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Estimated values$39.51 $28.92 $41.12 Risk-free interest rate4.7 %4.7 %2.2 %Dividend yield1.2 %1.6 %3.4 %Volatility36 %36 %40 %Summary of activities:Number of Stock Units Outstanding (In Millions)Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair ValueBalance as of December 30, 2023172.9 $37.05 Granted64.5 39.51 Vested(83.8)40.33 Forfeited(36.2)35.54 Balance as of December 28, 2024117.4 $36.52 Expected to vest104.3 $36.70 The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2024 was $2.4 billion ($2.2 billion in 2023 and $2.0 billion in 2022), which represents the market value of our common stock on the date that the RSUs vested. The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2024 was $3.4 billion ($2.7 billion in 2023 and $2.5 billion in 2022). The number of RSUs vested includes shares of common stock that we withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. RSUs that are expected to vest are net of estimated future forfeitures.As of December 28, 2024, unrecognized compensation costs related to RSUs granted under our equity incentive plans were $2.7 billion. We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.1 years.Stock Purchase PlanThe 2006 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. Under the 2006 ESPP, 523 million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance through August 2026. As of December 28, 2024, 118 million shares of common stock remained available for issuance.Employees purchased 39 million shares of common stock in 2024 for $972 million under the 2006 ESPP (43 million shares of common stock for $1.0 billion in 2023 and 27 million shares of common stock for $931 million in 2022). As of December 28, 2024, unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire shares of common stock under the 2006 ESPP totaled $63 million. We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately two months. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements95Table of ContentsNote 19 : Commitments and ContingenciesLeasesWe recognized operating leased assets in other long-term assets of $457 million ($505 million in 2023) and corresponding accrued liabilities of $181 million ($142 million in 2023), and other long-term liabilities of $279 million as of December 28, 2024 ($289 million in 2023). Our operating leases have remaining terms of 1 to 12 years and may include options to extend the leases for up to 37 years. The weighted average remaining lease term was 6.5 years, and the weighted average discount rate was 4.9% as of December 28, 2024 for our operating leases. Operating lease expense was $248 million in 2024 ($407 million in 2023 and $729 million in 2022), including $98 million in variable lease expense in 2024 ($213 million in 2023 and $551 million in 2022).We recognized finance leased assets in property, plant, and equipment of $470 million as of December 28, 2024 ($619 million as of December 30, 2023) of which the majority is related to a prepaid finance lease for supplier capacity. This lease will commence upon start of supplier production and has a term of 6 years.We also incurred non-cash impairment charges of $83 million on certain operating leased assets as a direct result of the 2024 Restructuring Plan (see \"Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). These charges were included within restructuring and other in the third quarter of 2024.Discounted and undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable leases as of December 28, 2024, were as follows:(In Millions)20252026202720282029 ThereafterTotalOperating lease payments$112 $74 $59 $46 $42 $119 $452 Finance lease payments$107 $106 $16 $6 $— $— $235 Present value of lease payments$614 CommitmentsCommitments for capital expenditures totaled $20.0 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($27.5 billion as of December 30, 2023), a majority of which will be due within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $7.0 billion as of December 28, 2024 (approximately $8.3 billion as of December 30, 2023). Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under supply agreements and various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services relate to agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Other purchase obligations reflect the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee under the agreement. Other purchase commitments also include our unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of Arizona SCIP in connection with the definitive agreement entered into with Brookfield during 2022. Our remaining unfunded contribution was $10.5 billion as of December 28, 2024. Legal ProceedingsWe are regularly party to various ongoing claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including those noted in this section. As of December 28, 2024, we have accrued a charge of $1.0 billion related to litigation involving VLSI and a charge of $401 million related to an EC-imposed fine, both as described below. Excluding the VLSI claims described below, management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate monetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time. In addition, in the second quarter of 2024, we accrued a charge of $780 million within restructuring and other related to three separate confidential settlement agreements with R2, Third Point, and TRGP (see R2 Semiconductor Patent Litigation below). The remaining unpaid liability was $655 million as of December 28, 2024.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements96Table of ContentsEuropean Commission Competition MatterIn 2009, the EC found that we had used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy microprocessors in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty (later renumbered Article 102) and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 by offering alleged “conditional rebates and payments” that required customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged “payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.” The EC ordered us to end the alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a €1.1 billion fine, which we paid in the third quarter of 2009.We appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) rejected our appeal of the EC decision in its entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. In January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC's 2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the €1.1 billion fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to us in February 2022. The General Court's January 2022 decision did not annul the EC's 2009 finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.In April 2022, the EC appealed the General Court's findings regarding rebates to the Court of Justice. In October 2024, the Court of Justice dismissed the EC's appeal, upholding the judgment of the General Court. In September 2023, the EC imposed a €376 million ($401 million) fine against us based on its 2009 finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products. We have appealed the EC's decision. We have accrued a charge for the fine and are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses in excess of this amount given the procedural posture and the nature of these proceedings.In a related matter, in April 2022, we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the EC to pay us approximately €593 million ($647 million) in default interest on the original €1.1 billion ($1.2 billion) fine that was held by the EC for 12 years. In November 2024, the EC paid us approximately €516 million ($560 million) in settlement of the applications. Litigation Related to Security VulnerabilitiesIn June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, the first variants of which are now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available.Consumer class action lawsuits against us were pending in the US and Canada. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by our actions and/or omissions in connection with Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of this class of security vulnerabilities that have been identified since 2018, and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the US, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions between 2018 and 2021 were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the US District Court for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor of Intel in July 2022 based on plaintiffs' failure to plead a viable claim. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's judgment in November 2023, ending the litigation. In November 2023, new plaintiffs filed a consumer class action complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California with respect to a further vulnerability variant disclosed in August 2023 and commonly referred to as “Downfall.” In August 2024, the district court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint for failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in September 2024, which we moved to dismiss in October 2024. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case relating to Spectre and Meltdown pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, and a stay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these matters.Litigation Related to Segment Reporting and Internal Foundry ModelA securities class action lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California in May 2024 against us and certain officers following the modification of our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to our new internal foundry operating model. In August 2024 the court ordered the case consolidated with a second, similar lawsuit, and in October 2024 plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint generally alleging that defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the growth and prospects of the foundry business and seeking monetary damages on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock or purchased call options or sold put options on our common stock from January 25, 2024 through August 1, 2024. We filed a motion to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint in December 2024. Given the procedural posture and the nature of the case, including that it is in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from the matter. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements97Table of ContentsSeveral stockholder derivative lawsuits have been filed in the Delaware state and federal courts since the filing of the securities class action lawsuit alleging that our directors and certain officers breached their fiduciary duties and violated the federal securities laws by making or allowing the statements that are challenged in the securities class action lawsuit. A similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California in December 2024, and transferred to the Delaware federal court in January 2025. In each derivative lawsuit, the plaintiff seeks to recover damages from the defendants on behalf of Intel. By stipulation of the parties, the Delaware state and federal courts have ordered the cases before them stayed pending certain developments in the securities class action lawsuit.  Litigation Related to Patent and IP ClaimsWe have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business.VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against us in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that various Intel FPGA and processor products infringe eight patents VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). VLSI sought damages, attorneys' fees, costs, and interest. Intel prevailed on all eight patents and the court entered final judgment in April 2024. VLSI appealed the Court's judgment of non-infringement as to one of the eight patents. In April 2019, VLSI filed three infringement suits against us in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas accusing various of our processors of infringement of eight additional patents it had acquired from NXP:▪The first Texas case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded VLSI $1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent and $675 million for infringement of another patent under the doctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding VLSI $2.2 billion in damages and approximately $162 million in pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. We appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including the court's rejection of Intel's claim to have a license from Fortress Investment Group's acquisition of Finjan. The Federal Circuit Court heard oral argument in October 2023. In December 2023, the Federal Circuit reversed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI was awarded $675 million. The Federal Circuit affirmed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI had been awarded $1.5 billion, but vacated the damages award and sent the case back to the trial court for further damages proceedings on that patent. The Federal Circuit also ruled that Intel can advance the defense that it is licensed to VLSI's patents. In December 2021 and January 2022 the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) instituted Inter Partes Reviews (IPR) on the claims found to have been infringed in the first Texas case, and in May and June 2023 found all of those claims unpatentable; VLSI has appealed the PTAB's decisions. In April 2024, Intel moved to add the defense that it is licensed to VLSI's patents. The motion remains pending. ▪The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that we do not infringe the asserted patents. VLSI had sought approximately $3.0 billion for alleged infringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. In September 2024, the court denied VLSI's motion for a new trial. Other post-trial motions remain pending, and the court has not yet entered final judgment. ▪The third Texas case went to trial in November 2022, with VLSI asserting one remaining patent. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, and awarded VLSI approximately $949 million in damages, plus interest and a running royalty. The court has not yet entered final judgment. In February 2023, we filed motions for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law notwithstanding the verdict on various grounds. Further appeals are possible. In April 2024, Intel moved to add the defense that it is licensed to VLSI's patents, and the court granted Intel's motion that same month.  Trial on the license defense has been set for May 2025. In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserted one patent against certain Intel Core processors. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) which held a hearing in September 2021. The Shenzhen court held trial proceedings in July 2021 and September 2023. VLSI sought an injunction as well as RMB 1.3 million in costs and expenses, but no damages. In September 2023, the CNIPA invalidated every claim of the asserted patent. In November 2023, the trial court dismissed VLSI's case.In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. asserting one patent against certain Intel core processors. The court held a trial hearing in December 2020, where VLSI requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an injunction. In December 2022, we filed a petition to invalidate the patent at issue. In February 2024, the patent was found not invalid, and Intel appealed the decision in May 2024. The appeal remains pending. The court held a second trial hearing in May 2022, and in October 2023, issued a decision finding no infringement and dismissing all claims. In November 2023, VLSI appealed the finding of non-infringement to the Supreme People's Court. The Supreme People's Court held an evidentiary hearing in October 2024, and a trial in November 2024. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements98Table of ContentsIn July 2024, Intel filed suit against VLSI in US District Court for the District of Delaware requesting the court find Intel is licensed to VLSI's patents. In September 2024, VLSI filed motions requesting that Intel's complaint be dismissed, transferred, or stayed.As of December 28, 2024, we have accrued a charge of approximately $1.0 billion related to the VLSI litigation. While we dispute VLSI's claims and intend to vigorously defend against them, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts given recent developments and future proceedings.R2 Semiconductor Patent LitigationIn November 2022, R2 Semiconductor, Inc. (R2) filed a lawsuit in the High Court of Justice in the UK against Intel Corporation (UK) Limited and Intel Corporation, and a lawsuit in the Dusseldorf Regional Court in Germany against Intel Deutschland GmbH and certain Intel customers. R2 asserts one European patent is infringed by Intel's Ice Lake, Tiger Lake, Alder Lake, and Ice Lake Server (Xeon) processors (the accused products), and customer servers and laptops that contain those processors. In July 2024, the UK High Court of Justice found the UK part of R2's European patent invalid. In February 2024, the Dusseldorf court found Intel's processors infringe and issued an injunction and recall order against Intel and its customers. In March 2024, R2 asserted the same patent against Fujitsu and Amazon Web Services in Dusseldorf Regional Court, accusing Ice Lake and Sapphire Rapids in the AWS suit; and Tiger Lake, Ice Lake, Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Sapphire Rapids in the Fujitsu suit. R2 seeks an injunction, recall, and damages. Intel is indemnifying and defending its customers. In March 2024, Intel Corporation Italia S.P.A. filed an action in the Tribunale di Milano seeking an order that Intel processors do not infringe R2's patent. In May 2024, R2 filed suit in Milan against Intel Corporation Italia S.P.A. and Italian affiliates of customers Dell, HP, and HPE, accusing Intel's Ice Lake (server and client), Tiger Lake, Alder Lake, and Raptor Lake processors of infringing its patent, and requesting that its suit be consolidated with Intel Corporation Italia S.P.A.'s suit. R2 is requesting an injunction and damages. In April 2024, R2 filed an action against Intel and its customers Dell, HP, and HPE for patent infringement before the Tribunal Judiciaire of Paris.  R2 sought an injunction. Intel and its customers filed a nullity action against the patent in France.In light of the potential disruption to Intel's and its customers' businesses in Europe were the Dusseldorf Regional Court's injunction and recall order to be enforced before a decision by the appeals court was expected, the significant delay expected before a decision by the appeals court, and the additional ongoing and potential litigation across other jurisdictions and with respect to other Intel processors and customers, in August 2024 Intel entered into three separate confidential agreements with R2, Third Point (the controlling shareholder), and TRGP Capital (a third-party organization funding the lawsuits) to resolve the injunction enforcement risk and related pending litigation, and provide for broad-based litigation peace with these entities, which included rights to other technology and services to Intel. Across the three agreements, Intel expects to pay an aggregate amount of $780 million.Business Interruption Insurance ProceedsWe received $484 million of insurance proceeds, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2022, to compensate for business interruption and property damage from a temporary electrical breakdown that occurred at one of our facilities in 2020. We recognized these receipts as a reduction of cost of sales.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements99Table of ContentsKey TermsWe use terms throughout our document that are specific to Intel or that are abbreviations that may not be commonly known or used.

A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on management's evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officers and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officers and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with US GAAP.Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Management's assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment.Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP. We reviewed the results of management's assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting, as stated in the firm's attestation report, which is included within Financial Statements and Supplemental Details.

CCG revenue decreased 8% due to lower notebook and desktop volume from lower demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of the year as customer inventory levels normalized compared to higher levels in the first half. Notebook ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of small core products combined with a higher mix of older generation products. This was partially offset by higher desktop ASPs due to an increased mix of product sales to the commercial and gaming market segments. DCAI revenue decreased 20% due to lower server volume resulting from a softening CPU data center market, partially offset by higher ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of high core count products. NEX revenue decreased 31% as customers tempered purchases to reduce inventories and adjust to a lower demand environment across product lines. We invested $16.0 billion in R&D, made capital investments of $25.8 billion, and had $11.5 billion in cash from operations and $(11.9) billion of adjusted free cash flow.RevenueGross MarginDiluted EPS Attributable to IntelCash Flows■ GAAP $B■ GAAP ■ Non-GAAP■ GAAP ■ Non-GAAP■ Operating Cash Flow $B■ Adjusted Free Cash Flow1 $B$54.2B40.0%43.6%$0.40$1.05$11.5B$(11.9)BGAAPGAAPnon-GAAP1GAAPnon-GAAP1GAAPnon-GAAP1Revenue down 14% from 2022 revenueGross margin down 2.6 ppts from 2022Gross margin down 3.7 ppts from 2022Diluted EPS down $1.54 or 79% from 2022Diluted EPS down $0.62 or 37% from 2022Operating cash flow down $4.0B or 26% from 2022Adjusted free cash flow down $7.8B or 191% from 2022Lower revenue in CCG, DCAI, and NEX.Lower GAAP gross margin from lower revenue, higher unit cost, and higher excess capacity charges, partially offset by the sell-through of previously reserved inventory, lower inventory reserves taken in 2023, lower product ramp costs, and the absence of one-time charges recognized in 2022.Lower GAAP EPS from lower gross margin and absence of one-time gains recognized in 2022, partially offset by lower R&D and MG&A spending, and a higher tax benefit.Lower operating cash flow primarily driven by lower net income, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital and other adjustments.Managing to our long-term financial modelOur 2023 results reflect the continued advancement of our transformational journey. We continued to prioritize investments critical to our IDM 2.0 transformation, achieved operational milestones, and executed disciplined expense management. To achieve our long-term financial model, we believe it is imperative that we drive to world-class product cost and operational efficiency. A key component of our overall strategy is our internal foundry model. Under this model, we intend to reshape our operational dynamics and establish transparency and accountability through standalone profit and loss reporting for our manufacturing group in 2024. We expect this model to enable increased efficiencies across a number of aspects of our organization that we believe are integral to achieving our financial and operational goals. At the same time, we continue to prioritize capital investments critical to our efforts to regain process leadership and establish a leading-edge, at-scale foundry business. 1  See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&A.Fundamentals of Our Business5Table of ContentsDelivering leadership productsWe seek to develop and offer leading products that will help enable a future in which every human can have more computing power and quicker access to data. We remain committed to our goal of delivering five technology nodes in four years to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. This year, we achieved several key milestones on our product roadmap, including: ▪We launched the Intel® Core™ Ultra processors, featuring our first integrated neural processing unit, for power-efficient AI acceleration and local inference on the PC.▪We introduced the 13th Gen Intel® Core™ mobile processor family, led by the launch of the first 24-core processor for laptops, and introduced the new Intel vPro® Platform powered by the full lineup of 13th Gen Intel Core processors.▪We introduced the 14th Gen Intel® Core™ desktop processor family, delivering fast desktop frequencies and enhanced desktop experience for enthusiasts.▪We launched the 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors, a critical part of our heterogeneous hardware and software portfolio to accelerate real-world data center, cloud and edge workloads, including AI, and also launched the 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors with Intel® vRAN Boost, a new general-purpose chip that fully integrates Layer 1 acceleration into the Xeon SoC and is designed to eliminate the need for external accelerator cards.▪We launched the 5th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors for data center, cloud, and edge, with embedded capabilities for powering AI workloads.▪We introduced two new Intel® Arc™ Pro Graphics Processing Units, Intel Arc Pro A60 and Intel Pro A60M, and shipped Intel Arc Pro A40-based systems. Investing in leading-edge, at-scale manufacturingWe are committed to strengthening the resilience of the global semiconductor supply chain for leading-edge semiconductor products by investing in geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. In the US, we are expanding our existing operations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, and investing in two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio. We have submitted all four of our major project proposals in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, estimated to represent over $100 billion of US manufacturing and research investments over the next five years, to the US Department of Commerce's CHIPS Program Office.In the European Union and Israel, we have announced a series of investments, spanning our existing operations in Ireland and Israel, as well as our planned investment of more than $33 billion in Germany to build a leading-edge wafer fabrication mega-site, and our plans to invest up to $4.6 billion in an assembly and test facility in Poland. We also announced the start of high-volume manufacturing using Intel 4 technology and EUV technology in Ireland.Unlocking valueWe continue to look for innovative ways to unlock value for our stakeholders. We sold a 32.4% minority stake in our IMS Nanofabrication business, including investments from Bain Capital and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Net proceeds resulting from the IMS minority stake sales totaled $1.4 billion. We also executed a secondary offering of Mobileye stock that generated net proceeds of $1.6 billion. Further, we communicated our intent to operate our Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) as a standalone business, with standalone financial reporting beginning January 1, 2024. This is expected to enable potential private and public equity investments. These transactions provide an additional source of capital to support the critical investments needed to advance our strategy. Fundamentals of Our Business6Table of ContentsOur StrategyTechnology permeates every aspect of our lives and is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence. As we look ahead to the next decade, we expect to see continued demand for processing power. Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering this digital expansion, and we are strategically positioning ourselves to create a resilient global semiconductor supply chain by investing in geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. The demand for compute is being accelerated by five superpowers: ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. Together these superpowers combine to amplify and reinforce each other, and will exponentially increase the world's need for computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever-smaller microchips. We intend to lead the industry by harnessing these superpowers for our customers' growth and our own.We are uniquely positioned with the depth and breadth of our silicon, platforms, and software, and packaging and process technology with at-scale manufacturing. With these strengths and the tailwinds of the superpowers driving digital disruption, our strategy to win is focused on four key themes: product leadership, open platforms, manufacturing at scale, and our people. Our PrioritiesProduct LeadershipLead and democratize compute with Intel x86 and xPU. Our product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from data center to network, PCs, edge computing, and the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, to serve an increasingly smart and connected world.At our core is the x86 computing ecosystem, which supports an extensive and deep universe of software applications, with billions of lines of code written and optimized for x86 CPUs. We continue to advance this ecosystem with x86 microarchitectures focused on performance, which push the limits of low latency and single-threaded application performance, and microarchitectures focused on efficiency, which are designed for computing throughput efficiency to enable scalable multithreaded performance. Beyond the CPU, we are delivering a growing family of xPU products, which encompass client and data center GPUs, IPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. The xPU approach recognizes that different workloads benefit from different computing architectures, and our broad portfolio helps meet our customers' increasingly diverse computing needs. As part of our strategy, we seek to develop and offer leading products across each of these architectural categories. We also seek to address every phase of the AI continuum, including the largest, most challenging GenAI and large language models. We believe AI represents a generational shift in computing by expanding human abilities and solving the most challenging problems. We are in the early stages of realizing AI's full potential and GenAI is just the beginning. Our strategy is to bring AI to where the data is being generated and used and we believe we have a full spectrum of hardware and software platforms, offering open and modular solutions, for competitive total cost of ownership and time to value that customers need to win in this era of exponential growth and AI everywhere. We are infusing AI into Intel technologies, supporting today's GenAI workloads, fueling emerging usages like AI PC and AI at the edge, and pioneering innovations that we believe advance the future of AI in the next decade. We believe our leadership in IP, process, packaging, security, software, services, manufacturing, and foundry services positions us to realize AI's full potential to transform industries and solve the world's biggest challenges.Fundamentals of Our Business7Table of ContentsOpen PlatformsWe aim to deliver open software and hardware platforms with industry-defining standards. Around the globe, companies are building their networks, systems, and solutions on open standards-based platforms. Intel has helped set the stage for this movement, with our historic contributions in developing standards such as CXL, Thunderbolt™, and PCI Express*. We also contributed to the design, build, and validation of open-source products in the industry such as Linux*, Android*, and others. The world's developers constantly innovate and expand the capabilities of these open platforms while increasing their stability, reliability, and security. In addition, microservices have enabled the development of flexible, loosely coupled services that are connected via application programming interfaces to create end-to-end processes. We use industry collaboration, co-engineering, and open-source contributions to accelerate software innovation. Through our oneAPI initiative, developers use a unified language across CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs that is designed to reduce development time and to enhance productivity. We also deliver a steady stream of open-source code and optimizations that are designed for projects across virtually every platform and usage model. We are committed to co-engineering and jointly designing, building, and validating new products with software industry leaders to accelerate mutual technology advancements and help new software and hardware work better together. Our commitment extends to developers through our developer-first approach based on openness, choice, and trust. Ultimately, we believe our pivot to a software-defined, silicon-enhanced strategy will enable us to realize value at all layers of the compute stack. This should allow us to continue to monetize foundational and ecosystem-enabling software through hardware sales, limited licensing, and customer-enabling service offerings. Additionally, we are expanding our software portfolio by developing and monetizing software solutions, services, and platforms with SaaS, software subscriptions, and other business models. We are prioritizing three portfolios of offerings for our SaaS and subscription-based software: AI, trust and security, and performance optimization. We are also scaling the availability of Intel® Developer Cloud, which is designed to enable developers to learn, prototype, test, and run their own AI workloads across multiple Intel hardware architectures to experience the competitive performance of Intel platforms and develop their AI software from today’s hardware portfolio to next-generation architectures.An open approach and deep engagement with the developer ecosystem are essential to lowering barriers to entry and unlocking AI innovations for developers and customers. We are expediting an open AI software ecosystem that we believe is needed to break down proprietary walls. We offer customers, partners, and developers early access and a rapid path to scale their AI solutions with the Intel Developer Cloud and integrated and scalable hardware and software systems and solutions. We believe AI will only be truly accessible to all when its use is ethical and responsible. Partnering with industry leaders, we are working to deliver innovative ecosystem tools and solutions intended to make AI safer and more secure, and help address privacy concerns as AI scales exponentially. We are building platforms and technologies for the convergence of AI and security to help customers confidently secure diverse AI workloads across the data center, cloud, PC, and edge.Manufacturing at Scale IDM 2.0, the next evolution and expansion of our IDM model, is a differentiated strategy that combines three capabilities:Internal factory network. Our global, internal factory network has been foundational to our success, enabling product optimization, improved economics, and supply resilience. We intend to remain a leading developer of process technology and a major manufacturer of semiconductors and will continue to build the majority of our products in our factories.Strategic use of foundry capacity. We expect to expand our use of third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, which will provide us with increased flexibility and scale to optimize our product roadmaps for cost, performance, schedule, and supply. Our use of foundry capacity will include manufacturing for a range of modular tiles on advanced process technologies. Open System Foundry. We are building a world-class foundry business to meet the growing long-term global demand for semiconductors. We plan to differentiate our foundry offerings from those of others through a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe available for customers globally, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other ecosystem IP. The current foundry model enabled explosion of ecosystem innovation at the wafer level. We believe this established model has historically served the industry well, but a new mindset is needed in our new era of chipmaking. As innovation evolves, we see the rack has collapsed into a system and the system has collapsed into an advanced package. We are building out an Open System Foundry that has four components: wafer fabrication, packaging, chiplet standard, and software.The Open System Foundry involves engaging with customers at multiple levels, from basic wafer manufacturing to helping define and implement their desired system architectures. We intend to build our customers' silicon designs and deliver full end-to-end customizable products built with our advanced packaging technology. We believe our IDM 2.0 strategy enables us to deliver leading process technology and products to meet growing long-term demand using internal and external capacity, while leveraging our core strengths to provide foundry services to others and providing superior capacity, supply resilience, and an advantageous cost structure. In the upcoming year, we plan to implement an internal foundry model, where our business units engage with our manufacturing group in an arm's-length fashion, similar to how fabless semiconductor companies engage with external foundries. The model is integral to our IDM 2.0 operational and financial strategies and aims to fully leverage our invested capital while serving a wide variety of chip customers worldwide.Fundamentals of Our Business8Table of ContentsRecent events, including the pandemic-related global chip shortage, made clear how supply chain disruptions can severely impact everyday life. The steady rise of chipmaking capacity in Asia has made the world vulnerable to continued and increasingly extreme shortages. We believe a secure, balanced, and resilient supply of semiconductors is essential to the interests of the entire global economy. With one of the most geographically balanced supply chains across North America, Europe and Asia, we plan to partner with the public sector to strengthen the resilience of the global semiconductor supply chain by investing in a more geographically balanced capacity. We believe our investments will help develop a more resilient supply chain for generations to come and hedge against geopolitical instability.Our PeopleOur world-class talent is at the heart of everything we do. Together we strive to have a positive effect on business, society, and the planet. Delivering on our strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent from across the world. Our people build our technology, unlock new business opportunities, and work with our partners and customers to create global impact.Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace where the world’s best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet.Growth ImperativeWe are investing to position the company for accelerated long-term growth, focusing on both our core businesses and our growth businesses. In our client and server businesses, our strategy is to invest to strengthen the competitiveness of our product roadmap and to explore new opportunities. We believe we have significant opportunities to grow and gain share in graphics; mobility, including autonomous driving; networking and edge; AI; software; and foundry services. Focus on Innovation and ExecutionWe are focused on executing our product and process roadmap and accelerating our cadence of innovation. We have set a detailed process and packaging technology roadmap and announced key architectural innovations to further our goal of delivering leadership products in every area in which we compete. We are returning our culture to its roots in innovation and execution, drawing on principles established by our former CEO Andy Grove that emphasize discipline and accountability. This includes using OKRs throughout the organization to drive a common purpose.To help us execute toward our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are leveraging our Smart Capital approach. This approach is designed to enable us to adjust quickly to opportunities in the market, while managing our margin structure and capital spending. The key elements of Smart Capital include:▪Smart capacity investments. We are aggressively building out manufacturing shell space, which gives us flexibility in how and when we bring additional capacity online based on milestone triggers such as product readiness, market conditions, and customer commitments. ▪Government incentives. We are continuing to work with governments in the US and Europe to advance and benefit from incentives for domestic manufacturing capacity for leading-edge semiconductors. ▪SCIP. We are accessing strategically aligned capital to increase our flexibility and help efficiently accelerate and scale manufacturing build-outs. This type of co-investment also demonstrates how private capital is unlocked and becomes a force multiplier for government incentives for semiconductor manufacturing expansion.▪Customer commitments. IFS is working closely with potential customers to make advance payments to secure capacity. This provides us with the advantage of committed volume, de-risking investments while providing capacity corridors for our foundry customers.▪External foundries. We intend to continue our use of external foundries where their unique capabilities support our leadership products.Fundamentals of Our Business9Table of ContentsOur CapitalWe deploy various forms of capital to execute our strategy in a way that seeks to reflect our corporate values, help our customers succeed, and create value for our stakeholders. CapitalStrategyValueFinancialLeverage financial capital to invest in ourselves and exit businesses to optimize our portfolio, both to drive our strategy and long-term value creation.We strategically invest financial capital to continue to build our business, create long-term value and provide returns to our stockholders.IntellectualInvest significantly in R&D and IP to enable us to deliver on our accelerated process technology roadmap, introduce leading x86 and xPU products, and develop new businesses and capabilities.We develop IP to enable next-generation products, create synergies across our businesses, expand into new markets, and establish and support our brands.ManufacturingBuild manufacturing capacity efficiently to meet the growing long-term global demand for semiconductors, aligned with our IDM 2.0 strategy.Our geographically balanced manufacturing scope and scale enable us to provide our customers with a broad range of leading-edge products and foundry capabilities.HumanBuild a diverse, inclusive, and safe work environment to attract, develop, and retain top talent needed to build transformative products.Our talented employees enable the development of solutions and enhance the intellectual and manufacturing capital critical to helping our customers win the technology inflections of the future.Social and RelationshipBuild trusted relationships for both Intel and our stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, customers, local communities, and governments.We collaborate with stakeholders on programs to empower underserved communities through education and technology, and on initiatives to advance accountability and capabilities across our global supply chain, including accountability for the respect of human rights.NaturalStrive to reduce our environmental footprint through efficient and responsible use of natural resources and materials used to create our products.With our proactive efforts, we seek to mitigate climate and water impacts, achieve efficiencies, lower costs, and position ourselves to respond to the expectations of our stakeholders.Comprehensive ESG and Corporate Responsibility Strategy: RISE Our commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability leadership is deeply integrated throughout our business. We strive to create an inclusive and positive work environment where every employee has a voice and a sense of belonging, and we are proactive in our efforts to reduce our environmental footprint through efficient and responsible use of natural resources and materials.We continue to raise the bar for ourselves and leverage our leadership position in the global technology ecosystem to make greater strides in corporate responsibility and apply technology to address social and environmental challenges. Through our RISE strategy, we aim to create a more responsible, inclusive, and sustainable world, enabled by our technology and the expertise and passion of our employees. Our corporate responsibility strategy is designed to increase the scale of our work through collaboration with our stakeholders and other organizations; we know that we cannot achieve the broad social impact to which we aspire by acting alone. More information about our RISE goals, including progress we have made toward achieving them, is included in our Corporate Responsibility Report1.1  The contents of our Corporate Responsibility Report are referenced for general information only and are not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital10Table of ContentsFinancial CapitalWe take a disciplined approach to our financial capital allocation strategy, which continues to focus on building stakeholder value and is driven by our priority to invest in the business and capacity and our capital needs. We also seek to pay competitive dividends, optimize our portfolio, look for innovative ways to unlock value across our assets, and, from time-to-time, engage in mergers and acquisitions. As we invest in our IDM 2.0 strategy and implement our next phase of capacity expansions and the acceleration of our process technology roadmap, our allocation priorities have shifted more heavily toward investing in the business and away from stock repurchases. In the long term, we will continue to look for opportunities to further our strategy through acquisitions while remaining disciplined on capital allocation. Cash from Operating Activities $B■ Cash from Operating Activities■ Adjusted Free Cash Flow1Our Financial Capital Allocation StrategyInvest in the BusinessOur first allocation priority is to invest in R&D and capital spending to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the world's demand for semiconductors. In 2023, we continued our focus on capital investment and the deployment of our Smart Capital strategy. Return Excess Cash to StockholdersOur capital allocation strategy includes returning excess cash to stockholders. We achieve this through our dividend policy and, when permissible, stock repurchases. In 2023, we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation, is expected to support the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy, and is designed to position us to create long-term value. We expect future stock repurchases to continue to be curtailed during this time of meaningful investment in capital.R&D and Capital Investments $BCash to Stockholders $B        ■ R&D■ Logic■ Memory2■ Repurchases■ DividendOptimize our Portfolio and Unlock ValueOur capital allocation strategy also includes opportunistic investment in and acquisition of companies that complement our strategic objectives. We look for acquisitions that supplement and strengthen our capital and R&D investments. We also seek to drive value creation through transactions such as the 2022 Mobileye IPO, the 2023 minority stake sales in IMS, and the 2023 announcement of our intent to operate PSG as a standalone business which we expect to enable potential private and public equity investments. Together, these transactions provide an additional source of capital to support the critical investments needed to advance our business strategy.Lastly, we take action when investments do not strategically align to our key priorities. In the last three years, we exited numerous businesses, including the NAND memory business and Intel® Optane™ memory business. 1 See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&A.2 2021-2023 capital investments in Memory are not presented due to the divestiture of the NAND memory business announced in October 2020. 2019 and 2020 capital investments presented include Memory.  Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital11Table of ContentsIntellectual CapitalResearch and DevelopmentR&D investment is critical to enable us to deliver on our accelerated technology roadmap, introduce leading products, and develop new businesses and capabilities in the future. We seek to protect our R&D efforts through our IP rights and may augment R&D initiatives by acquiring or investing in companies, entering into R&D agreements, and directly purchasing or licensing technology.Areas Key to Product LeadershipWe have intensified our focus on areas key to product leadership. Our objective with each new generation of products is to improve user experiences and value through advances in performance, power, cost, connectivity, security, form factor, and other features. We also focus on reducing our design complexity, re-using IP, and increasing ecosystem collaboration to improve our efficiency.Process and packaging. Our leading-edge process and packaging technology and world-class IP portfolio are key to the success of our strategy. We are committed to achieving process technology leadership in 2025 by planning to deliver five technology nodes in four years. In addition, we have solidified our process and packaging offerings to external customers through IFS.▪Intel 7 process node is in production for our 13th Gen Intel Core processors and represents the continuous improvement of transistor and interconnect performance.▪Intel 4, our first EUV node, delivers significant density scaling and approximately 20% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 7. The Intel Core Ultra processor is our first high-volume client product on Intel 4 and began shipping to customers in Q3 2023.▪Intel 3 is expected to deliver further logic scaling and up to 18% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 4. Intel 3 is our first advanced node offered to IFS customers and is optimized for the needs of data center products.▪Intel 20A will follow Intel 3 and will introduce two breakthrough technologies that we expect to deliver up to a 15% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 3: RibbonFET and PowerVia. RibbonFET, our implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, is designed to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins, but in a smaller footprint. PowerVia is our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery that is designed to optimize signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer.▪Intel 18A, our second IFS advanced node offering, will improve on Intel 20A by delivering ribbon innovation for design optimization and line width reduction. Intel 18A is expected to deliver an additional 10% improvement in performance per watt over Intel 20A.▪Beyond Intel 18A, we have initiated definition and development of our next two process nodes and continue to define, build, and develop the next-generation High Numerical Aperture EUV lithography into our process technology roadmap. To continue our modernization and infrastructure expansions, we have begun the installation of the world’s first High-NA EUV tool for commercial use at our Gordon Moore Park in Oregon.▪Our family of 3D advanced packaging technology will usher in the next generation of Foveros technology, enabling us to mix multiple top die tiles with multiple base tiles across mixed fab nodes, providing greater flexibility for disaggregated chip designs. Our future Foveros Direct technology should scale interconnect pitch below 10µm, enable direct copper-to-copper bonding for low-resistance interconnects, and blur the boundary between wafer and package. Longer term, we expect to deliver complete glass substrate solutions as the next generation of advanced packaging designed to enable continued scaling of transistors in a package.xPU architecture. We believe the future is a diverse mix of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial architectures deployed in CPU, GPU, IPU, accelerator, and FPGA sockets, enabled by a scalable software stack and integrated into systems by advanced packaging technology. We are building processors that span several major computing architectures, moving toward an era of heterogeneous computing: ▪CPU. We started shipping our 5th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors based on Intel 7 with built-in AI acceleration, cryptographic acceleration, and advanced security capabilities. We also launched our 14th Gen Intel Core processors, which are designed to scale from thin and light laptops to enthusiast desktop and notebook platforms. These are based on a hybrid architecture utilizing our most advanced performance cores and power-efficient cores.▪GPU and HPC. The Intel Arc graphics family offers modern GPU features to power today's demanding games, applications, and AI workloads. In 2023, the Intel Arc portfolio expanded while offering a substantial performance uplift through continual driver updates, offering consumer and professional solutions that target a significant part of the market. Intel Arc discrete GPUs currently ship in three performance tiers, with Intel Arc 7, 5, and 3 series for consumers, and Intel Arc Pro A60, A50, and A40 for workstations.

In Q1 2023, we launched the Intel® Xeon® CPU Max Series and Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series. Designed for the future compute demands of HPC and AI workloads, the Intel Max Series product family power the Aurora supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory.  Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital12Table of Contents▪Infrastructure Acceleration. Our first ASIC IPU has been deployed widely across Google Cloud. Our second generation IPU, is also co-developed with Google and is expected to tape in the first half of 2024. It is expected to double the throughput and compute capabilities. The IPU becomes the center of the CSP compute platform, with the bulk of CSP infrastructure cycles spent running on the IPU and not the host processor. This frees up processing cores for business-value applications and infrastructure as a service rental.▪Ethernet. Our 200G foundational network interface card targeting cloud, enterprise, and edge, is expected to go into production in 2H 2024 and extend our 100G market. Additionally, we plan to productize our 10G/2.5G/1G offering, a refresh of our high-volume 10G and 1G portfolio with modernized software, management, and manufacturing technologies. ▪Matrix Accelerator. We are showing strong customer and performance momentum for our Intel® Gaudi® AI accelerators. In Q3 2023, we announced that a large AI supercomputer would be built entirely on Intel Xeon processors and 4,000 Intel Gaudi 2 AI hardware accelerators, with Stability AI as the anchor customer.Software. Software unleashes the potential of our hardware platforms across all workloads, domains, and architectures. ▪oneAPI adoption continues to expand across the industry. oneAPI is designed to enable developers to build cross-architecture applications using a single code base across CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs to reduce development time and enhance productivity. Our oneAPI-based tools take advantage of unique hardware features and lower software development and maintenance costs. Developers can choose the best architecture for the problem at hand without rewriting their entire code base, accelerating their time to value.▪We seek to accelerate adoption of oneAPI and Intel software developer tools through diverse ecosystem activities, including developer training, summits, centers of excellence, access to Intel hardware and software through Intel Developer Cloud and industry collaboration through the Linux Foundation's Unified Acceleration (UXL) Foundation project. Our Intel Developer Cloud offering is designed to host global users spanning AI, data science, high-performance computing, media and graphics, and other accelerated computing workloads using oneAPI and the latest Intel hardware.▪We believe AI will be ubiquitous, and with our tools and the broad open software ecosystem, we are well-positioned to scale AI. We optimize and contribute software to popular frameworks, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, to achieve the best performance for Intel platforms and to deliver productivity and programmability for AI developers. We are accelerating the disruption of the proprietary ecosystems through Intel contributions to new software AI languages such as Triton, Mojo, and JAX. This higher level of open, vendor-independent programmability, combined with Intel's commitment to open spec governance, implementations, licensing models, and segment-optimized solutions, such as OpenVINO™ powered by oneAPI, offers customers a choice of hardware and software stack tailored to diverse workload needs.▪We seek to continually improve our system and foundational-level software in support of our client, data center, networking, and graphics products, delivering AI-optimized software across the stack, including BIOS, firmware, simulation, operating systems, and virtualization.IP RightsWe own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. We have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are granted. As we expand our product offerings, particularly around our foundry business, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties. The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.Efforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see \"Risk Factors\" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital13Table of ContentsManufacturing CapitalAs the guardians of Moore's Law, we continue to innovate to advance the design and manufacturing of semiconductors to help address our customers' greatest challenges. This makes possible new leadership products with higher performance while balancing power efficiency, cost, and size. Our IDM 2.0 strategy allows us to deliver leadership products using internal and external capacity while leveraging our core strengths to provide foundry services to others. IDM 2.0 combines three capabilities. First, we will continue to build most of our products in our fabs. Second, we expect to expand our use of third-party foundry capacity to manufacture a range of modular tiles on advanced process technologies. Third, we are building a world-class foundry business with IFS, which we expect will combine leading-edge packaging and process technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other ecosystem IP. Network and Supply ChainIn 2023, our factories delivered continuous support to our customers as we ramped new process technologies and equipment for our products and expanded Open System Foundry offerings. We continue to work across our supply chain to minimize disruptions, improve productivity, and increase overall capacity and output to meet customer expectations.Our global supply chain supports internal partners across architecture, product design, technology development, manufacturing and operations, sales and marketing, and business units, and our supply ecosystem comprises thousands of suppliers globally. Our mission is to enable product and process leadership, industry-leading total cost of ownership, and on-time and uninterrupted supply for our customers, delivered in a responsible and sustainable manner. As of the end of 2023, we had nine geographically dispersed manufacturing sites in production. The following map shows the locations of these factory sites. Our manufacturing facilities are primarily used for silicon wafer manufacturing, assembling, testing, and advanced packaging. We operate in a network of manufacturing facilities integrated as though they were one factory to provide the most flexible supply capacity, allowing us to better analyze our production costs and adapt to changes in capacity needs. Our new process technologies, when ready for high volume manufacturing, are transferred from a central development fab to one or more of our manufacturing facilities. The network of factories and the development fab collaborate to continue driving operational improvements. This enables fast ramp of the operation, quick learning, and quality control.We are expanding manufacturing capacity across multiple sites and geographies. These include silicon wafer manufacturing in Arizona, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Ohio, and Oregon and advanced packaging manufacturing in Malaysia and New Mexico. This year, we added Poland to our assembly and test expansion roadmap. These investments further our IDM 2.0 strategy and are expected to support a resilient semiconductor supply chain and to create the foundation for a next-generation chip ecosystem. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital14Table of ContentsHuman CapitalOur human capital strategy is grounded in our belief that our people are fundamental to our success. Delivering on our strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent across the world. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace where the world's best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet. We invest in our highly skilled workforce of 124,800 people (as of December 30, 2023) by creating practices, programs, and benefits that support the evolving world of work and our employees' needs. Our human capital philosophy includes three pillars we believe are needed to position our talent strategy as a competitive advantage:▪Hire and retain the best talent: We have embraced the future of work with a flexible, hybrid-first approach that differentiates Intel from competitors. ▪Develop our talent to full potential: We have updated role descriptions and career pathways to better enable movement and help top talent work on the highest priorities.▪Create a winning culture: We have reignited Intel's results-driven, performance culture.Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We believe that an inclusive culture is important for attracting, developing, and retaining top talent, and we strive to provide a work environment where all employees from all backgrounds are valued, challenged, and rewarded. We are focused on reinvigorating our culture to strengthen our execution and accelerate our cadence of innovation. Our values—customer first, fearless innovation, results driven, one Intel, inclusion, quality, and integrity—inspire us and are key to delivering on our purpose. All employees are responsible for upholding these values, the Intel Code of Conduct, and Intel's Global Human Rights Principles, which form the foundation of our policies and practices and ethical business culture.Talent ManagementWe continue to see significant competition for talent throughout the semiconductor industry. Our hiring was limited in 2023, in line with macroeconomic forecasts, financial performance, and cost-cutting measures, and we took actions to rebalance our workforce. However, the investments we are making to accelerate our process technology require continued and focused efforts to attract and retain talent—especially technical talent. Our undesired turnover rate1 was 5.6% in both 2023 and 2022.We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Intel an employer of choice. We offer extensive training programs and provide rotational assignment opportunities and have updated our job architecture to help employees create custom learning curricula for building skills and owning their careers. To further support the growth and development of our people, we continue to increase mentoring in our technical community, drive engagement through employee resource groups, and promote health and wellness resources to all our people. Through our annual employee experience survey, employee inclusion survey, and manager development feedback survey, employees can voice their perceptions of the company, their managers, their work experiences, and their learning and development opportunities. Our employees' voices are important to enable our culture of continuous improvement, and as a result, we link a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to year-over-year improvements of our employee experience survey results. Our performance management system is designed to support our cultural evolution and to increase our focus on disciplined OKRs.1 Undesired turnover includes all regular Intel employees who voluntarily left Intel, but does not include Intel contract employees, interns, or employees who separated from Intel due to divestiture, retirement, voluntary separation packages, death, job elimination, or redeployment. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital15Table of ContentsInclusionDiversity and inclusion are core elements of Intel's values and instrumental to driving innovation and positioning us for growth. Over the past decade, we have taken actions to integrate diversity and inclusion expectations into our culture, performance and management systems, leadership expectations, and annual bonus metrics. Through our annual employee inclusion survey, employees can voice their experiences at Intel and provide feedback on how we can continue to improve. We are proud of what we have accomplished to advance diversity and inclusion, but we believe we can achieve more, including beyond the walls of Intel. Our RISE strategy and 2030 goals set our global ambitions for the rest of the decade, including, in part, ambitious goals to achieve 25% representation of women in senior leadership; achieve 12% representation of underrepresented minorities in US senior leadership; achieve 10% representation of employees with a disability in our global workforce; and exceed 40% representation of women in technical roles, including engineering positions and other roles with technical job requirements. Our ambitious goals were established, in part, based on modeling of where market availability is expected to be in 2030. Market availability analysis will be re-conducted over the time period to assess ongoing alignment and expectations. To drive accountability, we continue to link a portion of our executive and employee compensation to diversity and inclusion metrics. We have committed our scale, expertise, and reach through our comprehensive RISE strategy to work with customers and other stakeholders to accelerate the adoption of inclusive business practices across industries. As part of the Alliance for Global Inclusion, we worked with a coalition of technology companies to create a global inclusion index survey, which serves as a benchmark for companies to track diversity and inclusion improvements, provide information on current best practices, and highlight opportunities to improve outcomes across industries. The results of the third global inclusion index survey were published in 2023 and shared with business leaders across industries. For the first time, based on the maturity of the respondents' best practices, the survey results transitioned to an index, in which organizations that received an overall score of 50% or higher across all regions in which they participated were recognized for their diversity and inclusion efforts. There were 27 respondents and, of those, 18 earned spots on the index, including Intel. This collective effort allows the industry to more clearly identify actions needed to advance progress on closing persistent gaps and advancing more inclusive practices in workplaces, industry, and society. The survey shows increased commitment to diversity and inclusion around key areas of workforce inclusivity, recruitment, advancement opportunities, and accountability. We will also continue to collaborate on initiatives that expand the diverse pipeline of talent for our industry, advance social equity, make technology fully inclusive, and expand digital readiness for millions of people around the world.2  Senior leadership refers to salary grades 10+ and equivalent grades. While we present male and female, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing of all gender identities.3 The term underrepresented minority (URM) is used to describe diverse populations, including Black/African American, Hispanic, and Native American employees in the US.Compensation and BenefitsWe structure pay, benefits, and services to meet the varying needs of our employees, helping support employee financial well-being with competitive compensation, investment opportunities, and financial resources. Our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave, parent reintegration, fertility assistance, flexible work schedules, sabbaticals, and on-site services. Since 2019, we have achieved gender pay equity globally and we continue to maintain race/ethnicity pay equity in the US. We achieve pay equity by closing the gap in average pay between employees of different genders or race/ethnicity in the same or similar roles after accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences, such as location, time at grade level, and tenure. We have also advanced transparency in our pay and representation data by publicly releasing our EEO-1 survey pay data since 2019. We believe that our holistic approach toward pay equity, representation, and creating an inclusive culture enables us to cultivate a workplace that helps employees develop and progress in their careers at all levels. Our \"hybrid-first\" approach to working was informed by employees surveyed around the globe and involves the majority of our employees splitting their time between working remotely and in the office. Hybrid-first and remote work options cast a wider recruitment net and support our ambition to hire the best global talent. Currently, there is no company-wide mandate on the number of days per week employees should be on site or how they should collaborate. Our goal is to enable remote and on-site work where it drives the best output, while providing our employees with equitable access to systems, resources, and opportunities that allow them to succeed.Health, Safety, and WellnessWe are committed to providing a safe and injury-free workplace. We regularly invest in programs designed to improve physical, mental, and social well-being. We provide access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs, including on-site health centers, and we aim to increase awareness of and support for mental and behavioral health. In support of our RISE goals, we intend to continue our efforts to build our strong safety culture and drive the global expansion of our corporate wellness program through employee education and engagement activities. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital16Table of ContentsSocial and Relationship CapitalWe are committed to engaging in initiatives that support our communities and help us develop trusted relationships with our stakeholders. Proactive engagement with our stakeholders and investments in social impact initiatives, including those aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, advance our position as a leading corporate citizen and create shared value for Intel, our global supply chain, and our communities.Economic and social. The health of our business and local economies depends in part on continued investments in innovation. We provide high-skill, high-paying jobs around the world, many of which are manufacturing and R&D jobs located in our factories. As we expand operations in both existing and new locations around the world, we are building a pipeline of qualified workers through our talent strategy and the many investments we are making in education. We also benefit economies through our R&D ecosystem spending, sourcing activities, employee spending, and tax payments. We make sizable capital investments and provide leadership in public-private partnerships to spur economic growth and innovation. We stand at the forefront of new technologies that are increasingly being used to empower individuals, companies, and governments around the world to solve global challenges. We aim to empower people through education and advance social initiatives to create career pathways into the technology industry. This includes our global Intel Digital Readiness Programs, such as AI for Youth and AI for Workforce, scaled in partnership with governments and institutions to empower individuals with digital readiness and AI skills. Additionally, we invest in multi-year partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities in the US to increase the number of Black/African Americans who pursue electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science fields. Our employees and retirees share their expertise through volunteer initiatives in the communities where we operate, volunteering 3.8 million1 hours over the past four years. These efforts contribute to our RISE goal to volunteer 10 million hours over a decade. Since 2020, we announced and further expanded upon the Intel RISE Technology Initiative, which provides an expanded channel to build deeper relationships with our customers and partners aligned with our corporate purpose and work to create shared value through our RISE strategy. Specifically, we are funding projects in areas such as using technology to improve health and safety, making technology more inclusive while expanding digital readiness, and carbon-neutral computing to help address climate change. Human rights commitment. We are committed to maintaining and improving systems and processes to avoid causing or contributing to adverse impacts on human rights in our own operations, products, and supply chain. We have established an integrated approach to managing human rights across our business, including senior-level management involvement and board-level oversight. We also meet throughout the year with external stakeholders and experts on human rights to continue to inform and evolve our human rights policies and oversight processes. While we do not always know nor can we control what products our customers create or the applications end users may develop, we do not support or tolerate our products being used to adversely impact human rights. Where we become aware of a concern that Intel products are being used by a business partner in connection with abuses of human rights, we intend to evaluate and restrict or cease business with the third party unless and until we have a high confidence that Intel's products are not being used to adversely impact human rights.1 This is a preliminary estimate. The final number will be reported in our 2023-24 Corporate Responsibility Report, to be issued later in 2024. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital17Table of ContentsSupply Chain ResponsibilityWe actively manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve overall performance and value creation for Intel, our customers, and our suppliers. To drive responsible and sustainable practices throughout our supply chain, we have robust programs to educate and engage suppliers that support our global manufacturing operations. We actively collaborate with other companies and lead industry initiatives on key issues such as improving transparency around climate and water impacts in the global electronics supply chain and, as part of our RISE strategy, we are advancing collaboration across our industry on responsible minerals sourcing. Through these efforts we help set electronics industry-wide standards, develop audit processes, and conduct training.Over the past decade, we have directly engaged with suppliers to verify compliance and build capacity to address risks of forced and bonded labor and other human rights issues. We perform periodic audits, and identify critical direct suppliers to engage through capability-building programs, which help suppliers build sustainability acumen and verify compliance with the Responsible Business Alliance and the Intel Code of Conduct. We also engage with indirect suppliers through our programs on forced and bonded labor, responsible minerals, and supplier diversity. To achieve our RISE goals, we are significantly expanding the number of suppliers covered by our engagement activities. The supply chain environmental team is also actively engaging suppliers to measure and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions footprints and the resulting impact on our footprint. These activities are intended to help us meet our long-term emissions reductions goals, including our goal to achieve net-zero upstream Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, which we announced in 2023.Our commitment to diversity and inclusion also extends to our suppliers. We believe a diverse supply chain supports greater innovation and value for our business. We have set additional spending targets with women-owned suppliers outside the US and with minority-owned suppliers globally to accelerate progress toward our goal to increase global annual spending with diverse suppliers to reach $2.0 billion in annual spending by 2030.Natural CapitalDriving to the lowest possible environmental footprint as we grow helps us create efficiencies, support our communities, and respond to the needs of our stakeholders. We invest in environmental projects and set company-wide environmental targets to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water use, and waste generation. We build energy efficiency into our products to help our customers lower their own emissions, energy usage, and costs, and we collaborate with policymakers and other stakeholders to use technology to address environmental challenges. In April 2022, we announced our new goal to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in our operations by 2040, creating an important target to strengthen our commitment to sustainable business practices. We furthered our commitment in 2023 by announcing our goal to reach net-zero upstream Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Our 2030 RISE goals continue to be important milestones to drive to higher levels of operational efficiency, including a goal of a 10% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions on an absolute basis from a 2019 baseline by 2030. We continue to take action on emissions reduction strategies focused on emissions abatement, and to make additional investments in renewable electricity, process and equipment optimization, and energy conservation. In 2023, we linked a portion of the executive and employee performance bonus to our goal to reduce our 2023 Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 130,000 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent, compared to 2022. Our RISE strategy also focuses on addressing climate change impacts upstream and downstream in the value chain. This includes improving product energy efficiency and increasing our \"handprint\"—the ways in which Intel technologies can help others reduce their footprints, including Internet of Things solutions that enable intelligence in machines, buildings, supply chains, and factories, and make electrical grids smarter, safer, and more efficient. In August 2023, we published our inaugural green bond report, which provides an update on the allocation of the net proceeds of the $1.3 billion principal amount of senior notes issued in 2022. We are using the proceeds from the green bond offering to fund projects that support our investments in sustainable operations, which can include items such as green buildings, energy efficiency, circular economy and waste management, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, water stewardship, and renewable energy. EnergyWe focus on reducing our own climate change impact, and over the past two decades have reduced our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy consumption. Through our RISE goals, we have committed to a goal of conserving 4 billion kWh of energy this decade. We have conserved 1.6 billion kWh1 of energy cumulatively since 2020. We also invest in renewable electricity and on-site alternative energy projects in support of our 2030 goal to achieve 100% renewable electricity use across our global operations. In 2023, continuing our practice of linking a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our corporate sustainability metrics, we linked a portion of the performance bonus to our 2023 target to reach 95% renewable electricity use globally. We reached our target and achieved 99%1 renewable electricity usage globally in 2023.1  This is a preliminary estimate. The final number will be reported in our 2023-24 Corporate Responsibility Report, to be issued later in 2024. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital18Table of ContentsWater StewardshipWater is essential to the semiconductor manufacturing process. We use ultrapure water to remove impurities from our silicon wafers, and we use fresh and reclaimed water to run our manufacturing facility systems. Through our RISE goals, we have committed to achieve net positive water globally, and as part of that effort, conserve 60 billion gallons of water in this decade. Water conservation reduces the amount of water needed from fresh water sources; we have conserved 35.9 billion gallons1 of water and enabled restoration of 9.6 billion gallons1 of water to local watersheds since 2020. In 2023, we linked a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our target to conserve and restore 12.0 billion gallons of water during the year.Circular Economy and Waste ManagementWe have long been committed to waste management, recycling, and circular economy strategies that enable the recovery and productive re-use of waste streams. Our 2030 goals include a target of zero waste2 to landfill, as well as implementation of circular economy strategies for 60% of our manufacturing waste streams in partnership with our suppliers. We continue to focus on opportunities to upcycle waste by improving waste segregation practices and collaborating with our suppliers to evaluate new technologies for waste recovery. In 2023, we linked a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our interim target to achieve 5% of waste to landfill.Governance and DisclosureWe are committed to transparency around our carbon footprint and climate risk, and use the framework developed by the TCFD to inform our disclosure on climate governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. For governance and strategy, we follow an integrated approach to address climate change, with multiple teams responsible for managing climate-related activities, initiatives, and policies, with senior-level management involvement and board-level oversight, including the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. We describe our overall risk management processes in our Proxy Statement, and describe climate-related risks and opportunities in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, the Intel Climate Change Policy, and \"Risk Factors\" within this Form 10-K. In addition to what is included in this Form 10-K, information about and progress toward our RISE goals is included in our Corporate Responsibility Report. Our Corporate Responsibility Report also includes a mapping of our disclosure to the TCFD, GRI and SASB frameworks. The Corporate Responsibility Report and our CDP Climate Change Survey are available on our website and are published annually.3 In November 2023, we published our first Climate Transition Action Plan, which is available on our website.1  This is a preliminary estimate. The final number will be reported in our 2023-24 Corporate Responsibility Report, to be issued later in 2024.2  Intel defines zero waste as less than 1%.3  The contents of our website and our Corporate Responsibility Report, Climate Change Policy, Climate Transition Action Plan and CDP Climate Change Survey are referenced for general information only and are not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital19Table of ContentsManagement's Discussion and AnalysisOur ProductsWe are a global IDM of CPUs and related solutions that we design, develop, manufacture, market, sell, support, and service.

Our IDM 2.0 strategy includes our pursuit of these complex manufacturing and market growth opportunities by making significant capital investments in leading-edge semiconductor technologies in order to create foundry capacity and establish IFS as a major provider of foundry services that provides semiconductor manufacturing solutions for others and for ourselves. We have made and expect to continue to make significant capital investments in furtherance of this strategy.Products and CompetitionWe seek to address this tectonic shift in the chip industry by enabling our customers to create optimized systems of chips by combining the best technologies from Intel and the ecosystem. We believe Open System Foundry is a world-class foundry offering, delivered from a resilient, secure, and sustainable source of supply and complemented by access to the systems of chips capabilities from Intel. The basic foundry offering is advanced process technologies backed by an ecosystem of IP, EDA, and design services, which enable customers to design as they would with other foundries. The systems of chips capabilities include advanced packaging technologies, software to accelerate bring-up and integration of complex chips, and driving standards that will improve system performance. With our IFS accelerator program members and the Arm and Synopsys agreements, we believe we are well on the way to building out a world-class foundry offering. With the rise of AI, our advanced packaging business is expected to be another unique advantage for Intel. Chips created with us or other foundries can be packaged using Intel's advanced packaging technologies, including 2D and 2.5D/3D solutions designed to enable large, highly scalable packages at competitive costs. We continue to drive technologies, capabilities, and standards needed to optimize systems of chips, including the Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express* standard for communication between chips in a system, which was demonstrated in silicon in 2023. We accelerate our customers' designs by providing services and software that leverage Intel's vast experience as a systems company. Our competitors are mostly pure-play foundries that focus on delivering a pure-play foundry offering from fabrication plants based primarily in Asia. Of the five major semiconductor foundries, TSMC, Samsung, Global Foundries (GF), United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), only Samsung is an IDM and foundry, and only GF is headquartered in the US. TSMC leads the market with 59% market share, followed by Samsung at 16% in 20221. Neither Samsung nor TSMC currently offers its most advanced nodes outside of Asia and both have limited advanced node capacity in the US. We believe the Open System Foundry model delivers differentiated capabilities to help our customers lead in their industries while bringing stability to the global semiconductor supply chain. The momentum and customer commitments we are seeing demonstrate that our strategy and offerings are resonating, and we look to build on this success in 2024 and in future periods.1Source: TrendForceMD&A35Table of ContentsFinancial PerformanceIFS Revenue $BIFS Operating Income (Loss) $BRevenue and Operating Income (Loss) Summary2023 vs. 2022Revenue was $952 million, up $483 million from 2022, driven by higher packaging revenue.

CCG revenue decreased 8% from 2022 primarily due to lower notebook and desktop volume driven by lower demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of the year as customer inventory levels normalized compared to higher levels in the first half. Notebook ASPs decreased due to the relative strength in the education market segment resulting in a higher mix of small core products combined with a higher mix of older generation products, and were partially offset by higher desktop ASPs due to an increased mix of product sales to the commercial and gaming market segments. DCAI revenue decreased 20% from 2022 due to lower server volume resulting from a softening CPU data center market, which was partially offset by higher server ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of high core count products. NEX revenue decreased 31% from 2022 as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories and adjust to a lower demand environment across product lines.Incentives offered to certain customers to accelerate purchases and to strategically position our products with customers for market segment share purposes, contributed approximately $700 million to our revenue during Q4 2023, the impacts of which were contemplated in our financial guidance for Q1 2024, as included in our Form 8-K dated January 25, 2024.2022 vs. 20212022 revenue was $63.1 billion, down $16.0 billion, or 20%, from 2021. CCG revenue was down 23% from 2021 due to lower notebook and desktop volume in the consumer and education market segments, and lower revenue due to the continued ramp down from the exit of our 5G smartphone modem business and lower demand for our wireless and connectivity products. Notebook volume decreased, driven by lower demand in the consumer and education market segments, while ASPs increased due to the resulting product mix. Desktop volume decreased, driven by lower demand in the consumer and education market segments while ASPs increased due to an increased mix of commercial products. DCAI revenue decreased 15% from 2021 due to lower server demand from enterprise customers, and due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories in a softening data center market. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from our FPGA business. Server ASPs decreased due to customer and product mix. NEX revenue increased 10% from 2021, driven by higher Ethernet ASPs and increased demand for 5G products, partially offset by lower demand for Network Xeon. Mobileye revenue increased 35% from 2021, primarily driven by higher demand for EyeQ products and Mobileye Supervision systems. The decrease in our \"all other\" revenue was due to revenue from the divested NAND memory business of $4.3 billion recognized in 2021, for which historical results are recorded in “all other,” and $584 million of revenue recognized in 2021 from a prepaid customer supply agreement.Incentives offered to certain customers to accelerate purchases and to strategically position our products with customers for market segment share purposes, particularly in CCG, contributed approximately $1.7 billion to our revenue during Q4 2022.MD&A38Table of ContentsGross MarginWe derived most of our overall gross margin in 2023 from the sale of products in the CCG and DCAI operating segments. Our overall gross margin dollars in 2023 decreased by $5.2 billion, or 19%, compared to 2022, and in 2022 decreased by $16.9 billion, or 39%, compared to 2021.

As of December 30, 2023, our capital investments classified as construction in progress totaled $43.4 billion ($36.7 billion as of December 31, 2022). These assets have not yet been placed into service and have not yet begun depreciating. As these construction-in-progress assets are placed into service, we expect to incur depreciation expense that impacts future production costs and, ultimately, cost of sales. To the extent we are unable to grow our revenues to offset these production costs, our gross margin and operating income will be unfavorably affected. Additionally, we could incur asset impairments on property, plant, and equipment assets if our IDM 2.0 strategy is not successful.Effective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 to 8 years. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, we estimate total depreciation expense in 2023 was reduced by $4.2 billion. We estimate this change resulted in an approximately $2.5 billion increase to gross margin, $400 million decrease in R&D expenses, and $1.3 billion decrease in ending inventory values. These estimates are based on the assets in use and under construction as of the beginning of 2023 and are calculated at that point in time. Most of the depreciation expense associated with this useful life change is included in overhead cost pools and is combined with other costs and other depreciation expense from assets placed into service after this calculation was performed, for which such costs are subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. As a result, the actual amount of impact from the useful life change that is included in our 2023 operating results and financial position is impractical to individually and specifically quantify on a year-over-year basis.Operating ExpensesTotal R&D and MG&A expenses for 2023 were $21.7 billion, down 12% compared to 2022. These expenses represent 40.0% of revenue for 2023 and 38.9% of revenue for 2022. In support of our strategy, we continue to make significant investments to accelerate our process technology roadmap. This requires increased investments in R&D and focused efforts to attract and retain talent. We have implemented certain cost-cutting measures while we continue to improve our product execution.

The 2022 Restructuring Plan, in conjunction with other initiatives, reduced our cost structure and allowed us to reinvest certain of these cost savings in resources and capacity to develop, manufacture, market, sell, and deliver our products in furtherance of our strategy. The cumulative cost of the 2022 Restructuring Program as of December 30, 2023 was $1.3 billion.Litigation charges and other includes a $1.2 billion benefit in 2023 due to a reduction in the previously accrued $2.2 billion charge as a result of developments in the VLSI litigation in Q4 2023. 2023 charges also include a $401 million charge for an EC-imposed fine. In 2009, we recorded and paid an EC-imposed fine that was subsequently annulled, resulting in a benefit of $1.2 billion in 2022. Also in 2023, we mutually agreed with Tower to terminate the acquisition agreement that was entered into during 2022 and, as a result, we paid a $353 million termination fee to Tower in accordance with the terms of the agreement.Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments and Interest and Other, NetYears Ended (In Millions)Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable equity securities$(36)$(787)$(130)Observable price adjustments on non-marketable equity securities 17 299 750 Impairment charges(214)(190)(154)Sale of equity investments and other 273 4,946 2,263 Gains (losses) on equity investments, net$40 $4,268 $2,729 Interest and other, net$629 $1,166 $(482)Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments, Net Ongoing mark-to-market adjustments recognized in 2023, 2022, and 2021 were primarily driven by our investment in Montage Technology, Co.

Our benefit from income taxes increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US jurisdictions. The 2023 shift in income was attributable to the 2022 tax costs associated with the gains recognized from the equity sale of McAfee and the divestiture of our NAND memory business.Our effective tax rate decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US jurisdictions and a change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform related to the capitalization of R&D expenses that went into effect in January 2022. In 2022 we recognized a benefit from taxes as compared to a provision for taxes in 2021 as the higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US jurisdictions and the change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform were only partially offset by the tax costs associated with the gains recognized from the equity sale of McAfee and the divestiture of our NAND memory business.In 2021 the OECD announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. Subsequently multiple sets of administrative guidance have been issued. Many non-US tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in 2024 (including the European Union Member States) with the adoption of additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. We are continuing to evaluate the impacts of enacted legislation and pending legislation to enact Pillar Two Model Rules in the non-US tax jurisdictions we operate in.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, supplemented by our total cash and investments1, is our primary source of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. These sources are further supplemented by our committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity and certain other Smart Capital initiatives that we have undertaken. Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; and potential and pending acquisitions, strategic investments, and dividends. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology. These plans include expanding existing operations in Arizona, Ireland, Israel, New Mexico, and Oregon, and investing in new leading-edge manufacturing facilities in Germany and Ohio. We also expect to continue to benefit from government incentives and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our investments. Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements. We expect our planned capital investments to continue to put pressure on our adjusted free cash flow in the short term.As we invest in multiple expansions, we expect our capital expenditures to continue to be higher than historical levels for the next several years. We expect to adjust the cadence of our investments based on the execution of our roadmap and changing business conditions. As of December 30, 2023, we had commitments for capital expenditures of $20.4 billion for 2024 and had $7.1 billion in capital expenditures committed in the long term. As of December 30, 2023, other purchase obligations and commitments in 2024 under our binding commitments for purchases of goods and services were $2.7 billion, with an additional $5.6 billion committed in the long term.We have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures and other purchase obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. For example, see \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our lease obligations, which include supply agreements structured as leases; \"Note 8: Income Taxes\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our tax obligations, including impacts from Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings; and \"Note 13: Borrowings\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our debt obligations. The expected timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition, some of our purchasing requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included in the amounts above. For example, some of these requirements are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by vendors on a purchase order basis within short time horizons.MD&A42Table of ContentsWhen assessing our current sources of liquidity, we include our total cash and investments1 as follows: (In Millions)Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Cash and cash equivalents$7,079 $11,144 Short-term investments17,955 17,194 Loans receivable and other5 463 Total cash and investments1$25,039 $28,801 Total debt$49,266 $42,051 1  See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&A.We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in investment-grade securities. Our sources of liquidity in 2023 included $1.5 billion from partner contributions, net proceeds of $1.6 billion from a secondary offering of Mobileye Class A common stock, $1.4 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of minority stakes in our IMS business to both Bain Capital and TSMC, and government incentives of $1.0 billion. Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, other securities, and non-recourse factoring arrangements with third-party financial institutions. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion and, as of December 30, 2023, we had no commercial paper obligations outstanding. During 2023, we issued a total of $11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing our outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures. We also amended both our five-year $5.0 billion variable-rate revolving credit facility agreement, extending that maturity date by one year to March 2028, and our 364-day $5.0 billion credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date to March 2024. As of December 30, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facilities.In Q1 2023, we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation, is expected to support the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy, and is designed to position us to create long-term value. In January 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share on the company's common stock, which will be payable on March 1, 2024 to stockholders of record as of February 7, 2024. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Our cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity, among other factors, for our strategic business requirements. In 2023 these actions included, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the amounts and timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. While such actions have benefited, and may further benefit, cash flow in the near term, we may experience a corresponding detriment to cash flow in future periods as these actions cease or as the impacts of these actions reverse or normalize. Our cash flows for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Net cash provided by operating activities$11,471 $15,433 $29,456 Net cash used for investing activities(24,041)(10,231)(24,283)Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities8,505 1,115 (6,211)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(4,065)$6,317 $(1,038)Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.For 2023 compared to 2022, the $4.0 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower 2023 net income after adjusting for non-cash items, partially offset by 2023 cash-favorable working capital changes compared to 2022.For 2022 compared to 2021, the $14.0 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower 2022 net income after adjusting for non-cash items, including the gain on the sale of McAfee and the pre-tax gain from the divestiture of our NAND business, partially offset by 2022 cash-favorable working capital changes compared to 2021.MD&A43Table of ContentsInvesting ActivitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; proceeds from capital-related government incentives; and proceeds from divestitures. Our capital expenditures were $25.8 billion in 2023 ($24.8 billion in 2022 and $18.7 billion in 2021). The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a lack of proceeds from the divestiture of our NAND business and from the sale of our remaining McAfee share that occurred in 2022, lower maturities and sales of short-term investments, and increased capital expenditures. These unfavorable cash flow impacts during 2023 were partially offset by higher 2023 proceeds from capital-related government incentives and by other cash favorable investment activities, including lower acquisitions during 2023.The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to increased maturities and sales of short-term investments, proceeds from the divestiture of our NAND business, and proceeds from the sale of our remaining share of McAfee, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from partner contributions and equity-related issuances.The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to higher debt issuances along with lower repayment of long-term debt, decreased dividend payments to stockholders, and increased proceeds from sales of subsidiary shares, partially offset by commercial paper issuances in 2022 that were subsequently repaid in 2023. Our total dividend payments were $3.1 billion in 2023, compared to $6.0 billion in 2022. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 125 quarters. Cash provided by financing activities in 2022 compared to cash used for financing activities in 2021 was primarily due to higher commercial paper and debt issuances, our 2022 curtailment of common stock repurchases, proceeds from the Mobileye IPO, and partner contributions for joint investments, partially offset by higher 2022 debt repayments. Critical Accounting EstimatesThe methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) we must make assumptions that are uncertain when the judgment is made, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our Consolidated Financial Statements. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was made.Refer to \"Note 2: Accounting Policies\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates, which are as follows, as well as our significant accounting policies:▪Inventories—the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory, net of factory excess capacity costs. Inventory reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering forecasted future demand and market conditions; ▪Long-lived assets—the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment and evaluation of useful lives of property, plant, and equipment; identified intangibles; and impairment of goodwill, including the determination of asset groupings and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units; and▪Loss contingencies—the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.MD&A44Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Beginning in 2023, income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 13% across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Prior-period non-GAAP financial measures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this updated approach.Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.Non-GAAP adjustment or measureDefinition Usefulness to management and investorsNAND memory businessWe completed the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND memory business to SK hynix on December 29, 2021 and fully deconsolidated our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in Q1 2022.We exclude the impact of our NAND memory business in certain non-GAAP measures. While the second closing of the sale is still pending and subject to closing conditions, we deconsolidated this business in Q1 2022 and management does not view the historical results of the business as a part of our core operations. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core business model and how management currently evaluates core operational performance. In making these adjustments, we have not made any changes to our methods for measuring and calculating revenue or other financial statement amounts.Acquisition-related adjustmentsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years.We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.Share-based compensationShare-based compensation consists of charges related to our employee equity incentive plans.We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these adjustments provide better comparability to peer company results and because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our core operating performance. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core business model, how management currently evaluates core operational performance, and additional means to evaluate expense trends, including in comparison to other peer companies.MD&A45Table of ContentsNon-GAAP adjustment or measureDefinition Usefulness to management and investorsPatent settlementA portion of the charge from our IP settlements represents a catch-up of cumulative amortization that would have been incurred for the right to use the related patents in prior periods. This charge related to prior periods is excluded from our non-GAAP results; amortization related to the right to use the patents in the current and ongoing periods is included.We exclude the catch-up charge related to prior periods for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because this adjustment facilitates comparison to past operating results and provides a useful evaluation of our current operating performance.Optane inventory impairmentA charge in 2022 as we initiated the wind-down of our Intel Optane memory business.We exclude these impairments for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges do not reflect our current operating performance. This adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.Restructuring and other chargesRestructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges may include periodic goodwill and asset impairments, certain pension charges, and costs associated with restructuring activity. 2023 includes a benefit as a result of developments in the VLSI litigation in Q4 2023, an EC-imposed fine, and a fee related to the termination of our agreement to acquire Tower. 2022 includes a benefit related to the annulled EC fine and 2021 includes a charge related to the VLSI litigation. We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our core operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.(Gains) losses on equity investments, net(Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists of ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable equity securities, observable price adjustments on non-marketable equity securities, related impairment charges, and the sale of equity investments and other.We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because it provides better comparability between periods. The exclusion reflects how management evaluates the core operations of the business.(Gains) losses from divestiture(Gains) losses are recognized at the close of a divestiture, or over a specified deferral period when deferred consideration is received at the time of closing. Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement entered into in connection with the first closing of the sale of our NAND memory business on December 29, 2021, a portion of the initial closing consideration was deferred and will be recognized between first and second closing.We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because they do not reflect our current operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.Adjusted free cash flowWe reference a non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted free cash flow, which is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow adjusted for (1) additions to property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from capital-related government incentives and partner contributions, (2) payments on finance leases, and (3) proceeds from the McAfee equity sale in 2022.This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in understanding our capital requirements and sources of liquidity by providing an additional means to evaluate the cash flow trends of our business. Since the 2017 divestiture, McAfee equity distributions and sales contributed to prior operating and free cash flow, and while the McAfee equity sale in Q1 2022 would have typically been excluded from adjusted free cash flow as an equity sale, we believe including the sale proceeds in adjusted free cash flow facilitate a better, more consistent comparison to current and past presentations of liquidity.Total cash and investmentsTotal cash and investments is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity, which include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and loans receivable and other.This non-GAAP measure is helpful in understanding our capital resources and liquidity position.MD&A46Table of ContentsFollowing are the reconciliations of our most comparable US GAAP measures to our non-GAAP measures presented:Years Ended (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Net revenue$54,228 $63,054 $79,024 NAND memory business— — (4,306)Non-GAAP net revenue$54,228 $63,054 $74,718 Gross margin percentage40.0 %42.6 %55.4 %Acquisition-related adjustments2.3 %2.1 %1.6 %Share-based compensation1.3 %1.0 %0.4 %Patent settlement— %0.3 %— %Optane inventory impairment— %1.1 %— %NAND memory business— %— %0.6 %Non-GAAP gross margin percentage43.6 %47.3 %58.1 %Earnings per share attributable to Intel—diluted$0.40 $1.94 $4.86 Acquisition-related adjustments0.33 0.37 0.36 Share-based compensation0.77 0.76 0.50 Patent settlement— 0.05 — Optane inventory impairment— 0.18 — Restructuring and other charges(0.01)— 0.65 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net(0.01)(1.04)(0.67)(Gains) losses from divestiture(0.04)(0.28)— NAND memory business— — (0.33)Adjustments attributable to non-controlling interest(0.02)— — Income tax effects(0.37)(0.31)(0.32)Non-GAAP earnings per share attributable to Intel—diluted$1.05 $1.67 $5.05 Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Net cash provided by operating activities$11,471 $15,433 $29,456 $35,864 $32,618 Net additions to property, plant, and equipment(23,228)(23,724)(18,567)(14,086)(15,948)Payments on finance leases(96)(345)— — — Sale of equity investment— 4,561 — — — Adjusted free cash flow$(11,853)$(4,075)$10,889 $21,778 $16,670 Net cash used for investing activities$(24,041)$(10,231)$(24,283)$(21,351)$(13,314)Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities$8,505 $1,115 $(6,211)$(12,842)$(18,129)MD&A47Table of ContentsRisk Factors and Other Key InformationRisk FactorsThe following summarizes the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. When any one or more of the following risks materialize from time to time, our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations can be materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations can also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations, or by various risks that are generally applicable to most companies. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including in the MD&A and Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.We are in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry.The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological, geopolitical, and market developments; changes in industry standards; changes in customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent product introductions and improvements. When we do not anticipate or respond to these developments, our competitive position can weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has intensified in recent years, and we expect it to continue to do so in the future. If we are not able to compete effectively, or if our foundry strategy is unsuccessful, our financial results will be adversely affected, including through reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.We face intense competition across our product portfolio. Our competitors include companies offering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; accelerator products such as GPUs, including those offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity and networking products; and other semiconductor products. Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms, such as the ARM architecture*, and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. For example, ARM-based products are being used in PCs and servers, which could lead to further development and growth of the ARM ecosystem. We also compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers. Some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads. For example, in 2020, Apple introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in place of our client CPUs, and we face increasing competition from Apple's products and ecosystem.Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as TSMC or Samsung, for the manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products. Manufacturing process and assembly and test improvements introduced by such foundries have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to increasingly competitive offerings by our competitors. Our process technology roadmap to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025 is subject to a number of risks, and we could fail to realize our goals, including due to changes in competitor technology roadmaps, changes affecting our projections regarding our technology or competing technology, and the risks described in the risk factor \"The development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and uncertainties.\" As an IDM, we have higher capital expenditures and R&D spending than many of our fabless competitors due to the high ongoing investments required to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity. We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or business collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which could have a significant impact on our competitive position. For example, we could face increased competition as a result of China's programs to promote a domestic semiconductor industry and supply chains.Our products compete based on a number of factors, including performance, energy efficiency, ease-of-integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by product and market segment. To the extent our products do not meet our customers' requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape, our business and results of operations can be harmed. Introduction of competitive new products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products, exert downward pricing pressure on our products, and adversely affect our business. For example, our competitors have introduced data center and client platform products with performance improvements and additional processor core counts that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment. Further, our DCAI revenue, platform ASPs and market share were negatively impacted by the competitive environment and the shift of customer spend towards GPUs during the past few years. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred in recent years, and more could occur in the future. Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.Risk Factors and Other Key Information48Table of ContentsWe have limited experience in the highly competitive and capital-intensive third-party foundry business. As we pursue our strategy to establish IFS as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, we will face intense competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC, Samsung, Global Foundries (GF), United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). To succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; multi-chip packaging; system integration; manufacturing capacity; price; margin; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Building and maintaining a competitive foundry business requires high ongoing investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances must be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped. Moreover, many of the largest potential IFS customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose products compete with our own. As a result, our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality information, intellectual property, and foundry capacity, among other competitive concerns, to attract and retain such customers. Our limited third-party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain talented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading-edge and legacy nodes. Our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of, regulatory and environmental restrictions imposed upon, and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm. These significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly uncertain. We are making significant, long-term and inherently risky investments in R&D and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a favorable return.To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, improve our products and processes, and make significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities, all ahead of competitors and market demand. The R&D efforts and capital investments we require are intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies. We incurred R&D expenses of $16.0 billion in 2023, $17.5 billion in 2022, and $15.2 billion in 2021. We are focusing our R&D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, AI, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, in four years and our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. Our investments are typically long-term and, even where successful, often do not contribute to our operating results for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate, including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our then 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. In such instances where we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, transistor density, die utilization, core counts, and/or new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we have faced and will face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages relative to our competitors and adverse impacts to our financial condition as a result of higher operating costs, including as a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity, higher leverage and borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of Intel's 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor would be delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utilization of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.Risk Factors and Other Key Information49Table of ContentsThe investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital expenditures above our historical levels. In recent years, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utilizing leading process technologies, including as a result of the use of EUV photolithography tools. Our ownership and operation of such high-tech fabrication facilities, and our need to build new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand, has resulted and will continue to result in our incurring large capital outlays and high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. Such capital outlays and costs include those related to utilization of existing facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are expected to deliver or demand for our products, foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and other unfavorable market factors. We could also be required to write off inventory or record excess manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. As we continue to make substantial investments in increasing our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, these underutilization risks may be heightened. Conversely, at times, demand may increase or we may fail to forecast accurately or produce the mix of products demanded. To the extent we are unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough, we are at times required to make production decisions and/or are unable to fully meet market demand, which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships.The development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and uncertainties.We are continually engaged in the development of next-generation technologies. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes and other technologies is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials or new production equipment, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes, and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially anticipated. We are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology, and in 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our then 7nm process technology that resulted in delays relative to our prior expectations. In 2022, Intel's 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor was delayed to allow for more platform and product validation time. These delays have allowed competitors using third-party foundries, such as TSMC, to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us, including improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which have helped increase the competitiveness of their products. Because of these prior delays in our process technologies, we may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products. Our efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process and packaging technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost, performance, power, and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&D investments, particularly as the development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses.Risks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, failure to achieve expected performance, power, and area improvements, and product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications). Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs, adversely affect our gross margins, and contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. A new process node typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields, and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes. As the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields that may also increase our costs to manufacture and warranty our products.Our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase.Risk Factors and Other Key Information50Table of ContentsFrom time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors; defects in materials; delays in obtaining or revising permits and licenses; interruptions in our supply of materials, resources, or production equipment; adverse changes in equipment productivity; and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields and could result in production timing delays. Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations.Our implementation of new business strategies and investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed.Our IDM 2.0 strategy requires implementation of new business strategies, as well as many internal structural, systems and process changes. We have entered new businesses and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by growth in semiconductor demand, ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud to edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU products, and silicon photonics. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we announced plans to establish IFS as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others and to implement an internal foundry operating model through updates to our processes, systems, and guardrails between our manufacturing and our individual product-based business units. The implementation of our internal foundry operating model requires many internal structural, system, and process changes to support the separation of the product and manufacturing sides of our business and our external foundry business, including a new ERP system. In parallel, we are undertaking significant efforts to separate out portions of our business, such as PSG and IMS, to raise capital and unlock value as we focus on our core product and manufacturing capabilities. Significant business changes are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2022, we wound down Intel Optane; in 2020, we agreed to sell our NAND memory business to SK hynix; and in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for those businesses. These new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices, margins, or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, we expect intense competition related to the significant opportunity we see in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs. Our Smart Capital approach to capital spending, alternative financing arrangements and pursuit of government grants involves risks and may not be successful.As we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have utilized our Smart Capital approach to capital spending in an effort to appropriately time and scale our capital investments. To support our capital investments, we have pursued alternative financing arrangements, such as our 2022 joint investment with Brookfield in the manufacturing expansion of our Arizona campus, and expect to enter into similar arrangements in the future. These transactions may fail to advance our business strategy, may include unfavorable pricing or other terms, and may fail to achieve their anticipated benefits. Our partners may also fail to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely and we may fail to resolve any potential disputes. Any of these risks, including our ability to effectuate any additional transactions at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, which may limit our ability to raise sufficient capital for our required investments.In addition, as part of our Smart Capital approach, we have applied for, received, and expect to receive additional grants and incentives from domestic and foreign local, regional and national governments. Legislation in the US and EU has been adopted to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions, but there is uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of funding we may receive and as to the conditions and restrictions that may apply to us as a recipient of such funding. For example, we expect to receive substantial grants from the US government under the CHIPS Act to support significant planned new fabrication facilities in the US and the German government under the EU Chips Act to support significant planned new fabrication facilities in Germany. However, governments may choose not to award grants and incentives in sufficient amounts or in a timely manner to support our capital investment plans and to offset the higher costs of operations in many of the locations of our facilities as compared to those of many of our competitors, or we may be unable to comply with the requirements and limitations of such grants and incentives. To the extent such funding is below our expectations, we elect not to accept any grants or incentives due to burdensome compliance requirements, or we are required to return any amounts received from any grants or incentives due to an inability to comply with any requirements or limitations contained therein, our anticipated cash requirements would increase.Risk Factors and Other Key Information51Table of ContentsChanges in product demand can adversely affect our financial results. Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our products varies within or among them. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, we expect the PC TAM to grow over time driven by factors such as a larger installed base, demand for AI capabilities, new platforms, shorter replacement cycles, and adoption in new markets; however, the PC industry has been highly cyclical in the past, and these growth expectations may not materialize, or we may fail to capitalize on them. Changes in the demand for our products, particularly our CCG, DCAI, and NEX platform products, have in the past and may in the future reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.Important factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:▪business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;▪consumer confidence, income levels, and customer capital spending, which can be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing or spending, taxation, interest rates, the credit market, current or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;▪geopolitical conditions, including trade policies and geopolitical tensions and conflicts;▪our ability to timely introduce competitive products; ▪competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;▪the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;▪customer order patterns and order cancellations, including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products, customers' products, and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles; and disruptions affecting customers, such as the delays in obtaining tools, components, and other supplies as a result of COVID-19-related port shutdowns in China that negatively impacted demand for our business in 2022, as well as the industry substrate and component shortages that negatively impacted demand across several of our businesses in 2021;▪market acceptance and industry support of our products and services, including the introduction and availability of software and other products used together with our products, such as software to harness the new AI capabilities of our latest CPUs, as well as our foundry services offerings through IFS; and▪customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user computing workloads, such as work- and learn-from-home trends.Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our core product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based on Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon processors. Our ancillary product offerings that extend beyond our core product lines typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced products, and at times are not profitable. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced core products in any of our market segments, or our ancillary products represent a greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross margin percentage has decreased and may decrease again.Macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including changes to trade policies and regulations, present significant risks to us in many jurisdictions.We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Our operations rely upon a supply chain that is also highly distributed, and with reliance in some instances on supplies or materials available in only one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the US accounted for 74% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, with revenue from billings to China contributing 27% of our total revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to execute our business strategy, manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control.Adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth; changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy; higher interest rates; tighter credit; inflation; lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure; increases in unemployment; and lower consumer confidence and spending. Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital and credit markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties, including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments. Risk Factors and Other Key Information52Table of ContentsTrade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets. They can also result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us. Sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, domestic sourcing initiatives, and decoupling of global trade networks, which could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets and have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.In particular, geopolitical and trade tensions between the US and China, one of our largest markets, have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to some of our products, and have affected customer ordering patterns. Further, the US has imposed restrictions on the export of US-regulated products and technology to certain Chinese technology companies, including certain of our customers. Specifically, in 2022 the US significantly increased US export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and on artificial intelligence and advanced computing products. In 2023, the US added to the restrictions in all three areas and also worked with Japan and the Netherlands to align on additional restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment. During this time, the US has increasingly added Chinese companies to prohibited lists. In response, China has restricted US access to certain minerals and has blocked certain companies that provide products to Taiwan's military from selling products in China. These restrictions have in some instances reduced our sales and in a number of instances required specific governmental authorizations or exceptions - $3.2 billion, or 6%, of our 2023 revenue was dependent upon US government export control authorizations, an amount that we expect may increase in future years. These and potential future restrictions could adversely affect our financial performance and result in reputational harm to us. In addition, a number of semiconductor companies in China, including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), are making significant investments, in many instances with the support of the Chinese government, in advanced semiconductor technologies to enable such companies to develop products and technologies that compete with ours. It is difficult to predict what further trade-related actions governments may take, the extent to which we may be able to mitigate the effects of any such actions, and the longer-term implications of such actions on the market opportunities for us and the competition we may face.We can also be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur, including:▪geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and terrorist activity, including, for example:▪Russia’s war with Ukraine, initiated in 2022, which resulted: in the imposition of financial and other sanctions and export controls against Russia and Belarus that caused us and other companies to limit or suspend Russian operations (we had no exports to Russia in 2023); Russia-imposed currency restrictions and regulations and other retaliatory trade and other actions; increased supply, commodity, and other costs; and increased risk of cyberattacks;▪tensions and conflict affecting Israel, where we have multiple semiconductor development centers and a leading-edge manufacturing facility and where our Mobileye business is headquartered and has most of its operations, and in surrounding areas, such as past conflicts in Lebanon and the current conflict in the Red Sea; and▪rising tensions between China and Taiwan;▪natural disasters, public health issues (including pandemics), and other catastrophic events;▪inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions, materials shortages or delays, and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;▪formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and changes in the ability to obtain export licenses, which could be changed without notice;▪government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from or distribute compensation or other funds in a particular country;▪adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives, including more favorable incentives provided to competitors;▪differing employment practices and labor issues, including restricted access to talent;▪ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;▪local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;▪continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the US and abroad; and▪fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, and in the capital and credit markets, which can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, interest rate changes, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors.Risk Factors and Other Key Information53Table of ContentsWe are subject to numerous risks associated with the evolving market for products with AI capabilities.The markets and use cases for products with AI capabilities have been rapidly evolving, are difficult to predict and may impact demand for our products. For example, in the last few years the demand for high-end GPUs for model training increased dramatically and has resulted and may continue to result in a significant shift in DCAI customer spend. The significant investments we have made to develop products and software to address what we believe will be increasing demand for AI capabilities may be insufficient, and we face significant hurdles, including whether demand will materialize, whether third-party developers will develop the software to utilize the AI capabilities of our products, and whether we will be successful in developing products that can compete with offerings by established competitors. Our use of AI technology may subject us to reputational, financial, legal, or regulatory risks. As we incorporate AI technology into our products and services, any failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of the evolving AI technology in our products and services may cause harm to our reputation or financial liability and, as such, may increase our costs to address or mitigate such risks and issues. AI technology may create ethical issues, generate defective algorithms, and present other risks that create challenges with respect to its adoption. In addition, evolving rules, regulations, and industry standards governing AI may require us to expend significant resources to modify, maintain, or align our business practices or products to comply with US and non-US rules and regulations, the nature of which cannot be determined at this time. Several jurisdictions around the globe, including the EU and certain US states, have already proposed or enacted laws governing AI. US federal agencies are likely to release AI regulations in the near future in light of the Biden administration’s October 30, 2023 Executive Order on AI. The regulatory environment surrounding the impact of the implementation of AI on our products and services may adversely affect our ability to produce and export products and as a result may cause harm to our reputation and financial liability. We rely upon a complex global supply chain.We have a highly complex global supply chain composed of thousands of suppliers. These suppliers provide direct materials for our production processes; supply tools, equipment, and IP (via licenses) for our factories; deliver logistics and packaging services; and supply software, lab and office equipment, and other goods and services used in our business. We also rely on suppliers to provide certain components for our products and to manufacture and assemble and test some of our components and products. From time to time, we are negatively impacted by supply chain issues, including:▪suppliers extending lead times, experiencing capacity constraints, limiting or canceling supply, allocating supply to other customers including competitors, delaying or canceling deliveries, or increasing prices;▪supplier quality issues;▪cybersecurity events, IP or other litigation, man-made or natural disasters, public health issues (including pandemics), operational failures, or other events that disrupt suppliers;▪long lead times to qualify alternate or additional suppliers, or the unavailability of qualified alternate suppliers; and▪increased legislation, regulation, or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices, such as heightened reporting and other obligations with regard to environmental impacts, the risk of forced labor, or supplier conduct that does not meet such standards, which can result in supply chain disruptions, the loss of a supplier, and the government seizure of goods.These and other supply chain issues can increase our costs, disrupt or reduce our production, delay our product shipments, prevent us from meeting customer demand, damage our customer relationships, or negatively affect our reputation. They may keep us from successfully implementing our business strategy and can materially harm our business, competitive position, results of operation, and financial condition. From time to time, our customers experience disruptions or shortages in their own supply chains that constrain their demand for our products. During the past several years, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, as well as outbreaks of COVID-19, caused supply chain disruptions and delays in obtaining tools and other components, and the semiconductor industry experienced widespread shortages of substrates and other components and available foundry manufacturing capacity. These shortages have previously limited our ability to supply customer demand in certain of our businesses, and have adversely affected customer demand for our products, as some customers have been unable to procure sufficient quantities of third-party components used together with our products to produce finished systems. It is difficult to predict the future impact of these shortages when they occur.To obtain future supply of certain materials and components, particularly substrates, and third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, we have entered into arrangements with some of our suppliers that involve long-term purchase commitments and/or large prepayments. These arrangements may not be adequate to meet our requirements, or our suppliers may fail to deliver committed volumes on time or at all, or their financial condition may deteriorate. If future customer demand over the horizon of such arrangements falls below our expectations, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, unneeded capacity, and increased costs, and our prepayments may not be fully utilized, and in some cases may not be fully recoverable. We utilize third-party foundries and component suppliers to manufacture or supply certain components and products for areas such as networking, communications, graphics, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we expect to increase our use of third-party foundries. Delays in the development of foundries’ future manufacturing processes could delay the introduction of products or components we design for such processes, and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent us from meeting customer demand. We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, yields, quality, product quantities, and costs for components and products that are manufactured by third parties. Risk Factors and Other Key Information54Table of ContentsWhere possible, we seek to have several sources of supply. However, for certain components, services, materials, and equipment, we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location, which can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. For example, ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) is currently the sole supplier of EUV photolithography tools that we are deploying in our Intel 4 and subsequent manufacturing process nodes. These tools are highly complex to develop and produce, and increasingly costly, and from time to time there are increases in lead times or delays in their development and availability, which could delay the development or ramp of our future process nodes. As a further example, a limited number of third-party foundries offer leading-edge manufacturing processes, and these providers are geographically concentrated in Asia. Supplier consolidation or business failures can also reduce the pool of qualified suppliers. We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues. From time to time, we identify product defects, errata, and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or gain through acquisitions, can also contain defects. Product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third-party products and software. We face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or applications, including transportation, autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses. Costs from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:▪writing off some or all of the value of inventory;▪recalling products that have been shipped;▪providing product replacements or modifications;▪providing consideration to customers, including reimbursement for certain costs they incur;▪defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages;▪paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies; and▪reputational harm.These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and/or result in delay or loss of revenue. Mitigation techniques designed to address product issues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis—or at all—and do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues for all applications. We and third parties, such as hardware and software vendors, make prioritization decisions about which product issues to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation and result in costs. Product defects, errata, or other product issues and/or mitigation techniques can result in product failures, adverse performance and power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and other issues. Product issues can damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases or deployment, result in legal liability, or make our products less competitive, which could harm our business and financial results. Subsequent events or new information can develop that change our assessment of the impact of a product issue. In addition, our liability insurance coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products.We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products, as well as the operating systems and workloads that run on them and the components that interact with them. Components and IP we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard specifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. Our processors and other products are being used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category known as side-channel vulnerabilities, such as the variants referred to as \"Spectre\" and \"Meltdown.\" Additional categories and variants have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified. Publicity about these and other security vulnerabilities has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Security and manageability features in our products cannot make our products absolutely secure, and these features themselves are subject to vulnerabilities and attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become known. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a security vulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become aware of additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products, and address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.Risk Factors and Other Key Information55Table of ContentsMitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities in our products, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, are not always available on a timely basis—or at all—and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness, and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether, when, and how to develop and deploy mitigations. Export restrictions may impede our ability to provide updates or patches to customers in certain geographies or that appear on sanctions lists, potentially leaving systems unpatched and open to exploitation. Further, sanctions lists may include third parties with whom we need to interact for coordinated vulnerability disclosure, which may impair our ability to receive information about vulnerabilities and to deliver mitigations for them. We and such third parties make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation. Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties.Security vulnerabilities and any limitations or adverse effects of mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For example, whether or not vulnerabilities involve attempted or successful exploits, they may result in our incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, providing product replacements or modifications, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. These effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are available, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation. We are subject to increasing and evolving cybersecurity threats and privacy risks.We face significant and persistent cybersecurity risks due to: the breadth of geographies, networks, and systems we must defend against cybersecurity attacks; the complexity, technical sophistication, value, and widespread use of our systems, products and processes; the attractiveness of our systems, products and processes to threat actors (including state-sponsored organizations) seeking to inflict harm on us or our customers; the substantial level of harm that could occur to us and our customers were we to suffer impacts of a material cybersecurity incident; and our use of third-party products, services and components. Such an incident, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding our internal systems, writing down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation or enforcement proceedings, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain a business relationship with us, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties, as well as incurring significant reputational harm. We regularly face attempts by malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our suppliers, customers, partners, end users, or other third parties; steal proprietary, personal, or confidential information related to our business, products, employees, suppliers, or customers; introduce malicious software to our systems or those of our suppliers, customers, partners, end users, or other third parties; interrupt our systems and services or those of our suppliers, customers, or others; or demand ransom to return control of such systems and services. As we grow certain emerging business lines, such as our foundry business and our cloud computing and software-as-a-service offerings, we expect to collect or host significant amounts of highly sensitive customer data, which may increasingly make us a target of attempts to steal or corrupt that data. Individuals and organizations, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored organizations, insider threats including employees and third-party service providers, and intruders into our physical facilities, at times attempt to gain unauthorized access to and/or corrupt the processes used to design and manufacture our hardware products and our associated software and services. We are also a frequent target of attackers that intend to sabotage, compromise, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. In some instances, we, our suppliers, our customers, and the users of our products and services may be unaware of a threat or incident or its magnitude and effects, or we may be unable to timely mitigate the impacts of an incident.Cyber attack attempts are increasing in number, magnitude, and technical sophistication, and if successful may expose us and the affected parties to loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions to our business operations, including our manufacturing operations, and could impact our financial results. We expect emerging technologies to contribute to the increasing sophistication of attacks and to lead to new threats. For example, threat actors may leverage emerging AI technologies to develop new hacking tools and attack vectors, exploit vulnerabilities, obscure their activities, and increase the difficulty of threat attribution.As a developer of leading-node processes and widely utilized products, we have been, and expect to continue to be, the subject of intense efforts by sophisticated cyber adversaries, including state-sponsored organizations, who seek to compromise our systems, disrupt our operations or those of users of our products, or steal trade secrets. As geopolitical or armed global conflicts escalate, attacks against us, our customers, or our strategic allies may similarly intensify. For example, from 2019 to 2021, we, along with other companies with meaningful operations in Israel, were targets of concerted cyberattacks. In the fourth quarter of 2020, our Habana Labs subsidiary’s network was breached in connection with a suspected unsuccessful ransomware attack, resulting in unauthorized third-party access of certain confidential information.Risk Factors and Other Key Information56Table of ContentsWe are also subject to risks associated with attacks on products, services and components in our supply chain, such as the 2020 compromise of IT infrastructure management software provided by SolarWinds Corporation. These providers can experience breaches of their systems and products, or provide inadequate updates or support, which can impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or confidential information. Since 2021, we have observed an increase in ransomware attacks in our supply chain. In December 2021, a vulnerability named “Log4Shell” was reported for the widely used Java logging library, Apache Log4j* 2, and similar vulnerabilities affecting commonly used programs and tools were reported in 2022 and 2023. We are required to comply with stringent, complex, and evolving laws, rules, regulations, and standards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to cybersecurity and data privacy. Our compliance efforts are complicated by the fact that these requirements and obligations may be subject to uncertain or inconsistent interpretations and enforcement, and may conflict among various jurisdictions. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, standards, certifications, or contractual obligations, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, modification, acquisition, disclosure, release, or transfer of personal information, may result in outcomes such as: requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices; the expenditure of substantial costs, time, and other resources; proceedings or actions against us; legal liability; governmental investigations; enforcement actions; claims; fines; judgments; awards; penalties; sanctions; and potentially costly litigation (including class actions).The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business, including data stored with vendors or other third parties, could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Costs to comply with and implement privacy-related and data-protection measures are significant, and noncompliance could expose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and even criminal sanctions. Even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data-protection laws and regulations could result in audits, regulatory inquiries, or proceedings against us by governmental entities or other third parties.We are subject to IP risks, including related litigation and regulatory proceedings. We cannot always protect our IP or enforce our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP and IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries and other geopolitical factors. We are not always able to obtain protection for our IP or enforce or protect our IP rights. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. From time to time, governments adopt regulations—and governments or courts render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and business. In some cases, our IP rights can offer inadequate protection for our innovations. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced. This risk is heightened as competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees.Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to some of our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.Third parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business. We face claims based on IP rights from individuals, companies, investment litigation entities, other non-practicing entities, academic and research institutions, and other parties. We have seen an increase in patent assertions and lawsuits initiated by well-funded non-practicing entities, including entities funded by third-party investment firms. These lawsuits can increase our cost of doing business, impact our reputation or relationship with customers, and could disrupt our operations if they succeed in blocking the trade of our products. The patent litigation environment has also become more challenging due to the emergence of venues adopting procedural and substantive rules that make them more favorable for patent asserters and courts in which injunctions are available for non-competitors. As a result, we believe we are facing a more hostile IP litigation environment than in past years.We are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products, technologies, or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets, confidential information, or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, in many instances we agree to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers' businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.Risk Factors and Other Key Information57Table of ContentsAs a result of IP rights claims, we could:▪pay monetary damages, payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, royalties, fines, or penalties;▪stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;▪need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or▪enter into settlement or license agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and may be costly.These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Many of our products are designed to include third-party technology or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. In addition, from time to time, third parties notify us that they believe we are using their IP. There is no assurance that any necessary licenses or our existing licenses to such third-party IP can be obtained or are available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party technology, or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. To the extent our products include software that contains or is derived from open-source software, we may be required to make the software's source code publicly available and/or license the software under open-source licensing terms.We are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory matters. From time to time, we face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, commercial, IP, labor and employment, compliance, and other issues. As described in \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur, including monetary damages, fines, penalties, or injunctions stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, harmful to our reputation, and distracting to management.We must attract, retain, and motivate key talent. We believe that hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical talent, sales representatives, and other professionals are critical to our business. The competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense, with the demand often exceeding supply. Competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees, and the availability of flexible, hybrid, or work-from-home arrangements has both intensified and expanded competition. In addition, changes in immigration policies may further limit the pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. From time to time, we have intensified our efforts to recruit and retain talent, such as during 2021 and 1H 2022, and these efforts have increased our expenses. Further, we may not be successful in attracting, retaining, and motivating the workforce necessary to deliver on our strategy, and we have been required to curtail our planned hiring and reduce our workforce to respond to business conditions that differ from our expectations, which can be disruptive, compromise our ability to deliver on our strategy and workforce goals, and impact our ability to recruit in the future. Changes in employment-related laws applicable to our workforce practices may also result in increased expenses and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. Sustained declines in our stock price or lower stock price performance relative to our competitors have been reducing the retention value of our share-based awards, which can impact the competitiveness of our compensation. Our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. To the extent our compensation programs and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive, or changes in our workforce and related restructuring, reduction-in-force or other initiatives are not viewed favorably, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees can be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. In addition, significant or prolonged turnover may negatively impact our operations and culture, as well as our ability to successfully maintain our processes and procedures, including due to the loss of historical, technical, and other expertise. Changes in our management team and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent we do not effectively hire, onboard, retain, and motivate key employees, our business can be harmed.We are subject to risks associated with our strategic transactions and investments.We routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions, which are an important component of our financial allocation strategy. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:▪our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;▪failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and failure of its anticipated benefits to materialize;▪disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management's attention;▪failure of partners to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely;▪our inability to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding a project, property, or entity;▪failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, or at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals on a timely basis or without materially burdensome conditions or mandated acquisitions, divestitures, or disposals, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or other unforeseen factors;Risk Factors and Other Key Information58Table of Contents▪our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, and restructuring charges;▪our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses;▪our inability to retain key personnel of acquired or majority-owned businesses or our difficulty in integrating or separating employees, business systems, and technology or otherwise operating the acquired or majority-owned business;▪controls, processes, and procedures of acquired or majority-owned businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations and create complexity and inconsistency in application of controls, processes and procedures, and our failure to identify and/or address compliance issues, including accounting errors, or liabilities;▪our inability to resolve impasses or disputes with partners, including as a result of differences in our interests or goals;▪our failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, accounting and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets, majority-owned businesses or novel transactions; and▪the potential for our transactions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt.Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition, divestiture or partial divestiture, or several concurrent strategic transactions. Moreover, our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we at times need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions or otherwise investing our resources in a manner that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives. Where an existing investment does not strategically align to our key priorities, we routinely evaluate opportunities for possible divestitures and other options. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of divestitures due to risks that include unfavorable prices and terms; changes in market, macroeconomic, or geopolitical conditions affecting the regions or industries in which we or counterparties operate; changes in applicable laws; failure to receive regulatory or governmental approvals; limitations or restrictions due to regulatory or governmental approvals, litigation, contractual terms, or other conditions; delays in closing; lack of support by third parties; actions by competitors; adverse effects on our business relationships, operating results, or business due to the announcement and pendency of such transactions; and continued financial obligations, unanticipated liabilities, or transition costs associated with such transactions. In some cases, we are not able to divest investments on acceptable terms or at all.In addition, we make investments in public and private companies to further our strategic and financial objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return in a timely fashion, if at all. Our ability to realize a return on our investment in a private company, if any, is typically dependent on the company participating in a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, which at times includes bankruptcy, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment.We are subject to sales-related risks.We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties, such as distributors, value-added resellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs and ODMs. We depend on many distributors to help us create end-customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. At times, we rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products is limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products is not always easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties often sell products that compete with our products, and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. From time to time, they may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Further, any violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business, including subjecting us to litigation or regulatory risk. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.From time to time, our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized \"gray market.\" Our policies and procedures designed to keep our products away from the gray market may not be successful in achieving this objective. Gray market products can distort demand and pricing dynamics in our distribution channel and certain geographies, which at times adversely affects our revenue opportunities. Gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more challenging. Gray market products also sometimes include parts that have been altered or damaged, and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to be substandard. We receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Collectively, our three largest customers accounted for 40% of our net revenue in 2023, 42% of our net revenue in 2022 and 43% of our net revenue in 2021. We expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future.Risk Factors and Other Key Information59Table of ContentsIndustry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increased the significance and purchasing power of certain customers, particularly hyperscalers, in some of our data center-focused businesses. The cloud and cloud applications represent an increasingly demanding computing environment. The further consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and applications; product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product security and security features. Our competitive position can be eroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors. We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, including serving cloud service provider customers, and the competitive environment adversely affected our results in DCAI in 2023 and 2022. Some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including designs customized for their specific computing workloads. In addition, cloud services can be marketed to end users based on service levels or features rather than hardware specifications, or they can abstract hardware under layers of software, which can make it more difficult to differentiate our products to customers and end users. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely affected, and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads from their own internal data center infrastructures to cloud service providers. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud customer specifications, order changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs. The loss of key customers, a substantial reduction in sales to them, or changes in the timing of their orders can lead to a reduction in our revenue, increase the volatility of our results, and harm our results of operations and financial condition. For information about our customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from both US and non-US governments associated with grants, incentives, and sales of our products and services, and we are seeking to increase our sales of products and services to governmental entities in the future. Government demand and payment are often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including, with respect to US government contracts, congressional approval of appropriations, and can be adversely impacted by shutdowns of the US federal government. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, certain agreements with the US government are subject to special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, security, customers, and/or employees, and failure or inability to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or debarment from future business with the US government.We face risks related to our debt obligations.As we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have incurred significant debt obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including our ability to fully implement our strategy. As of December 30, 2023, we had $50.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and other borrowings outstanding. In addition, we have a commercial paper program of up to $10.0 billion and credit facilities to backstop these programs and otherwise provide access to committed capital of up to $10.0 billion. As we continue to pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy, we expect to incur additional indebtedness, refinance our existing debt, and issue additional notes or other debt securities in the future at a variety of interest rates, maturities, and terms. The semiconductor industry is a cyclical business and our revenue, cash flows, and outlook often fluctuate in accordance with this cycle, as well as prevailing macroeconomic conditions, our business strategy, and other risks described in these risk factors. These fluctuations, together with our debt level and related debt service obligations, could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing the risk of a future downgrade in our credit ratings that can potentially impact the value of our outstanding debt and increase our borrowing costs. We may also be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, debt refinancing, future acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, which will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Consequently, we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could adversely impact our ability to finance our business strategy and service and repay outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due, all of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and the cost of borrowing. We have significantly reduced our return of capital to stockholders in recent years. In recent years, we have not made repurchases of our stock and reduced the amount of our quarterly dividend. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at the current level, or at all. In addition, we are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program and there can be no assurances as to the amount, timing, and execution of any future share repurchases, or that any repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. Risk Factors and Other Key Information60Table of ContentsLaws and regulations can have a negative impact on our business. We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions and affect our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy and localization requirements; competition; advertising; employment and labor; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. For example, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G or autonomous driving technology and MaaS may limit global adoption, impede our strategy, or negatively impact our long-term expectations for our investments in these areas. Expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data-protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and services, particularly in cloud, Internet of Things, and AI applications, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads.Our policies, controls, and procedures designed to help provide for compliance with applicable laws cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.We are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in US dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the US where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as non-US dollar capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates can harm our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in our effective tax rate may impact our net income. A number of factors can impact our future effective tax rate or cash payments, which could cause significant variability in our financial results including:▪changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;▪changes in our business or legal entity operating model;▪the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;▪changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;▪adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of tax returns;▪increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;▪changes in available tax credits, including non-US tax credits, R&D credits and refundable tax credits;▪expirations or changes in our ability to secure new tax holidays and incentives;▪changes in US federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including the global implementation of a minimum tax under Pillar Two of the OECD BEPS initiative;▪changes in US GAAP; and▪our decision to repatriate non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for incremental taxes including any local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.Catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations and business, and those of our customers and suppliers, can be disrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health issues and global pandemics such as COVID 19; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation restrictions or disruptions, telecommunications, or IT systems providers; manufacturing equipment failures; geopolitical conflict; terrorism; or other catastrophic events. For example, we have at times experienced disruptions in our manufacturing processes as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, and disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, including cybersecurity incidents affecting our suppliers. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change can result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities, including our facilities located in water-sensitive regions such as Arizona and Israel. In addition, to the extent we are unable to successfully manage and conserve water resources, our reputation could be harmed. In recent years, the west coast of the US has experienced significant wildfires, including in Oregon, where we have major manufacturing facilities, and in California, where we are headquartered. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the technology industry in particular are unclear but could be severe. Risk Factors and Other Key Information61Table of ContentsCatastrophic events including global pandemics could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. The COVID-19 pandemic previously resulted in substantial economic uncertainty and volatility and disrupted historical patterns related to demand for our products and services that may impact our ability to accurately predict future demand, trends, or other matters that may impact our financial performance. While we maintain business recovery plans, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from such disruptions. Furthermore, even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly, if our customers or suppliers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, we may experience reduced or cancelled orders or disruptions to our supply chain that may adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, safety, and product regulations. The design, manufacturing, assembly and test of our products require the use and purchase of materials and chemicals that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our operations and those of our suppliers are further governed by regulations prohibiting the use of forced labor (e.g., mining conflict minerals), and restrictions on other materials, as well as laws or regulations governing the operation of our facilities, sale and distribution of our products, and use of our real property. The scope and interpretation of such laws and regulations, including the materials they govern, are complex and continue to evolve. The procedures and processes in place under our compliance program may become onerous or increasingly expensive to maintain and cannot guarantee compliance by employees or third parties to whom such laws apply. The amendment or expansion of these laws or regulations, as well as our failure or inability to comply with them (including as a result of acquired entities) can result in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; increased costs; additional remediation obligations; suspension of production; alteration, suspension, or termination of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes, including due to an inability to find, afford, or attain adequate substitute materials, equipment, or processes; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. In addition, the failure or inability to comply by our suppliers of these materials can require us to suspend or alter our production processes and sources, and result in increased risks and costs.The failure or inability by us or our customers and suppliers to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental regulations, including with respect to the materials and processes we are permitted to use and as to air quality and wastewater requirements, may impede our ability to manufacture products or expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future. Environmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, cease the use of a particular material or process, remove or remediate hazardous substances, or incur other expenses or liabilities. Regulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements. For example, semiconductor manufacturing uses perfluorocarbons, which have historically made up a large portion of our direct greenhouse gas emissions. New or increased regulations limiting the use of such compounds, or other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to install additional abatement equipment, purchase carbon offsets, and/or alter, where feasible, our production processes and sources. In addition, new or increased climate change regulation could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities. Regulations in response to human health concerns may also limit or prohibit the use of a class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are found in parts, components, process chemicals and other materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. Such chemicals are critical to the manufacturing and functioning of many semiconductor products and there are limited technically and commercially feasible alternatives to them. As we expand our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, the impacts of future regulation could be magnified. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations are also subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.Our initiatives and new legal requirements with respect to corporate responsibility matters present various risks. Our corporate responsibility initiatives, including our RISE strategy and related goals, could expose us to heightened scrutiny and numerous financial, legal, reputational, operational, compliance, and other risks, including lost customer opportunities, which could negatively impact us. Our achievement of initiatives, aspirations, and goals related to corporate responsibility matters, including those related to sustainability, is not guaranteed and is subject to numerous conditions, risks, and expectations; as well as standards, processes, and methodologies that continue to evolve. Further, any failure to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives that meet our stakeholders' evolving expectations could also negatively impact us.In addition, we are or expect to become subject to various new or proposed climate-related and other sustainability laws and regulations, including, for example, the state of California's new climate change disclosure requirements, the EU's new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and proposed climate-change disclosure requirements from the SEC. Compliance with such laws and regulations, as well as the overall increased focus and scrutiny from the SEC and other regulators, investors, customers, vendors, employees, and other stakeholders concerning ESG and climate matters, could impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks, including resulting in changes to our current ESG goals.Risk Factors and Other Key Information62Table of ContentsSales and Marketing CustomersWe sell our products primarily to OEMs, ODMs, and cloud service providers. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For information on customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase Intel processors and other products from our distributors. Certain of our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets.Sales ArrangementsOur products are sold through distribution channels throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. Because our customers generally order from us on a purchase order basis, they can typically cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using electronic and web-based processes that allow customers to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.In accordance with contract terms, the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, usually 30 days after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors can exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. DistributionDistributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.Seasonal TrendsHistorically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. In 2021, continued strong COVID-driven notebook demand in the first half of the year contributed to a flatter trend than we historically observe. In 2022, we had a flatter trend than we historically observe as we experienced the uncertainty and impacts, including demand volatility and supply chain disruption, of macroeconomic conditions, the potential for a recession, and the risk for continued COVID-related disruptions or shutdowns. In 2023, our net revenue seasonality was more consistent with our historical pre-pandemic trend.MarketingOur global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, differentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives preference with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Atom, Celeron®, Pentium®, Intel® Movidius™, and Intel Xeon trademarks make up our key CPU brands. This year we introduced our new Intel® Core™ Ultra processors, powering the latest AI PCs, and our 5th Gen Intel Xeon processors, built with AI acceleration in every core. We also continue to bring to market new software services including independent attestation security with Intel® Trust Authority, Intel® Granulate™ for workload compute optimization, and Intel Developer Cloud to accelerate AI development. Our foundry services business aims to offer leading-edge packaging and process technology, geographically balanced manufacturing capacity and a world-class IP portfolio.Risk Factors and Other Key Information63Table of ContentsWe promote brand awareness and preference and generate demand through our own direct marketing, as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press relations. We market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for our products. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as connectivity.Certain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs. These cooperative advertising and marketing programs broaden the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Certain customers are licensed to place Intel® logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to customers meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not eliminate, the impacts of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange RatesWe are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-US-dollar-denominated investments in debt and equity instruments, and may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-US-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in US dollars. However, a portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies, primarily the Israeli shekel, the Malaysian ringgit, the European Union euro, the Japanese yen, and the Chinese yuan. We have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-US-dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-US-dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards or option contracts in these hedging programs. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 10% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions outstanding as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, would result in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $53 million and less than $64 million, respectively.Interest RatesWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and provide financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally track the SOFR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into SOFR-based returns. We also entered into swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into floating-rate coupon payments for a portion of our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.A hypothetical change in benchmark interest rates of 1%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our investment portfolio of less than $100 million as of December 30, 2023 and as of December 31, 2022.Taking into account fixed-rate debt that is swapped to floating-rate debt, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 1% would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $120 million from debt outstanding as of December 30, 2023 (a hypothetical increase of 1% would have resulted in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $120 million from debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022).Equity PricesWe are exposed to equity market risk through our investments in marketable equity securities, which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activities. As of December 30, 2023, the fair value of our marketable equity securities was $1.2 billion ($1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022). The substantial majority of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of December 30, 2023 was concentrated in securities traded on the Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity securities, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio. Assuming a decline of 35% in market prices, the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by $418 million, based on the value as of December 30, 2023 (a decrease in value of $670 million, based on the value as of December 31, 2022 using an assumed decline of 50%). Risk Factors and Other Key Information64Table of ContentsWe utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities.Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as IPOs, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $4.6 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($4.6 billion as of December 31, 2022) and include our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. of $1.1 billion ($1.1 billion as of December 31, 2022). Commodity Price RiskAlthough we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities. CybersecurityWe face significant and persistent cybersecurity risks due to: the breadth of geographies, networks, and systems we must defend against cybersecurity attacks; the complexity, technical sophistication, value, and widespread use of our systems, products and processes; the attractiveness of our systems, products and processes to threat actors (including state-sponsored organizations) seeking to inflict harm on us or our customers; the substantial level of harm that could occur to us and our customers were we to suffer impacts of a material cybersecurity incident; and our use of third-party products, services and components. We are committed to maintaining robust governance and oversight of these risks and to implementing mechanisms, controls, technologies, and processes designed to help us assess, identify, and manage these risks. While we have not, as of the date of this Form 10-K, experienced a cybersecurity threat or incident that resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations, there can be no guarantee that we will not experience such an incident in the future. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding our internal systems, writing down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing modifications or replacements to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain a business relationship with us, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties, as well as incurring significant reputational harm. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. We have seen an increase in cyberattack volume, frequency, and sophistication. We seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their occurrence and recurrence where practicable through changes or updates to our internal processes and tools and changes or updates to our products and services; however, we remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats. In some instances, we, our suppliers, our customers, and the users of our products and services can be unaware of a threat or incident or its magnitude and effects. Further, there is increasing regulation regarding responses to cybersecurity incidents, including reporting to regulators, which could subject us to additional liability and reputational harm. See \"Risk Factors\" for more information on our cybersecurity risks and product vulnerability risks.We aim to incorporate industry best practices throughout our cybersecurity program. Our cybersecurity strategy focuses on implementing effective and efficient controls, technologies, and other processes to assess, identify, and manage material cybersecurity risks. Our cybersecurity program is designed to be aligned with applicable industry standards and is assessed annually by independent third-party auditors. We have processes in place to assess, identify, manage, and address material cybersecurity threats and incidents. These include, among other things: annual and ongoing security awareness training for employees; mechanisms to detect and monitor unusual network activity; and containment and incident response tools. We actively engage with industry groups for benchmarking and awareness of best practices. We monitor issues that are internally discovered or externally reported that may affect our products, and have processes to assess those issues for potential cybersecurity impact or risk. We also have a process in place to manage cybersecurity risks associated with third-party service providers. We impose security requirements upon our suppliers, including: maintaining an effective security management program; abiding by information handling and asset management requirements; and notifying us in the event of any known or suspected cyber incident.Our Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of cybersecurity risk, which it manages as part of our enterprise risk management program. That program is utilized in making decisions with respect to company priorities, resource allocations, and oversight structures. The Board of Directors is assisted by the Audit & Finance Committee, which regularly reviews our cybersecurity program with management and reports to the Board of Directors. Cybersecurity reviews by the Audit & Finance Committee or the Board of Directors generally occur at least twice annually, or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable. A number of Intel directors have experience in assessing and managing cybersecurity risk. Risk Factors and Other Key Information65Table of ContentsOur cybersecurity program is run by our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports to our Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Our CISO is informed about and monitors prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation efforts through regular communication and reporting from professionals in the information security team, many of whom hold cybersecurity certifications such as a Certified Information Systems Security Professional or Certified Information Security Manager, and through the use of technological tools and software and results from third party audits. Our CISO and CTO have extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and cybersecurity risk. Our CISO has served in that position since 2015 and, before Intel, was previously the Chief Security Officer at McAfee and the Chief Information Officer and CISO for the US House of Representatives. Our CTO joined Intel in 2021 and was previously Senior Vice President and CTO at VMware, with responsibility for product security. Our CISO and CTO regularly report directly to the Audit & Finance Committee or the Board of Directors on our cybersecurity program and efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate issues. In addition, we have an escalation process in place to inform senior management and the Board of Directors of material issues.PropertiesAs of December 30, 2023, our major facilities consisted of:(Square Feet in Millions)UnitedStatesOtherCountriesTotalOwned facilities38 28 66 Leased facilities2 5 7 Total facilities40 33 73 The facilities described above, including our principal executive offices located in the US, are suitable for our present purposes.

Our last share repurchase under this authorization occurred in Q1 2021, and no shares were repurchased during the fiscal year ending December 30, 2023. As of December 30, 2023, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of which $7.2 billion remained available. We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.Rule 10b5-1 Trading ArrangementsOur directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may from time to time enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5–1(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act.

On March 2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one such sanction. Though Intel has suspended sales in Russia, there may be a need to file documents or engage with FSB as Intel winds up our local offices. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B issued by the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB. On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.Risk Factors and Other Key Information69Table of ContentsFinancial Statements and Supplemental DetailsWe have defined certain terms and abbreviations used throughout our Form 10-K in \"Key Terms\" within this section.Index to Consolidated Financial StatementsPageReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm(PCAOB ID: 42)71Consolidated Statements of Income74Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income75Consolidated Balance Sheets76Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows77Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity78Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements79BasisNote 1: Basis of Presentation79Note 2: Accounting Policies79Performance and OperationsNote 3: Operating Segments85Note 4: Non-Controlling Interests86Note 5: Earnings Per Share88Note 6: Other Financial Statement Details88Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges90Note 8: Income Taxes91Investments, Long-Term Assets, and DebtNote 9: Investments93Note 10: Acquisitions and Divestitures95Note 11: Goodwill95Note 12: Identified Intangible Assets96Note 13: Borrowings96Note 14: Fair Value99Risk Management and OtherNote 15: Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)100Note 16: Derivative Financial Instruments101Note 17: Retirement Benefit Plans103Note 18: Employee Equity Incentive Plans106Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies108Key Terms112Index to Supplemental DetailsControls and Procedures115Exhibits116Form 10-K Cross-Reference Index12170Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel CorporationOpinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intel Corporation (the Company) as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 25, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Auditor's Reports71Table of ContentsInventory ValuationDescription of the MatterThe Company's net inventory totaled $11.1 billion as of December 30, 2023, representing 5.8% of total assets. As explained in \"Note 2: Accounting Policies\" within the consolidated financial statements, the Company computes inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and applies judgment in determining saleability of products and the valuation of inventories. The Company assesses inventory at each reporting date in order to assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the products have achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers; the determination of normal capacity levels in its manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory; whether the product is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of saleable quality. Auditing management’s assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the determination of excess and obsolete inventory reserves and lower of cost or net realizable value is judgmental and considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as customer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand. Additionally, for certain new product launches there is limited historical data with which to evaluate forecasts.How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over the costing of inventory, the determination of whether inventory is of saleable quality, the determination of demand forecasts and related application against on hand inventory, and the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value reserves including related estimated costs and selling prices.Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions (e.g., estimated product demand forecasts, costs and selling prices) of the underlying data used in management’s inventory valuation assessment. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends. We assessed whether there were any potential sources of contrary information, including historical forecast accuracy or history of significant revisions to previously recorded inventory valuation adjustments, and performed sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in inventory valuation that would result from changes in the assumptions. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP      We have served as the Company's auditor since 1968.San Jose, CaliforniaJanuary 25, 2024 Auditor's Reports72Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel CorporationOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited Intel Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intel Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated January 25, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP                          San Jose, CaliforniaJanuary 25, 2024Auditor's Reports73Table of ContentsConsolidated Statements of

53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2023 and 2021 were 52-week fiscal years; 2022 was a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal 2024 is a 52-week fiscal year. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Intel and our wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, which include entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting interest models. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates.Note 2 : Accounting PoliciesRevenue RecognitionWe recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or services to customers. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sales. Our products often include a software component, such as firmware, that is highly interdependent and interrelated with the product and is substantially accounted for as a combined performance obligation. In accordance with contract terms, the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms. We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Variable consideration is estimated and reflected as an adjustment to the transaction price. We determine variable consideration, which consists primarily of various sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. Sales rebates earned by customers are offset against their receivable balances. Rebates earned by customers when they do not have outstanding receivable balances are recorded within other accrued liabilities.We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs for marketing activities for some of our products. We generally record the payment as a reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned, unless the payment is for a distinct service, which we record as an expense when the marketing activities occur.InventoriesWe compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities and associated costs change in nature from R&D to cost of sales, and when cost of sales can be capitalized as inventory. For a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as PRQ. We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. A single PRQ has previously valued inventory up to $870 million in the quarter the PRQ milestone was achieved. Prior to PRQ, costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost of sales in the period incurred.The valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities. We apply our historical loading compared to our total available capacity in a statistical model to determine our expectations of normal capacity level. If the factory loading is below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges were $834 million in 2023, $423 million in 2022, and insignificant in 2021.Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle, variations in market pricing, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. Lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserves fluctuate as we ramp new process technologies, with costs generally improving over time due to scale and improved yields. Additionally, inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical changes in market conditions and the associated pricing environment. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements79Table of ContentsThe valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We use a demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we write off amounts considered to be excess inventory. Long-Lived AssetsProperty, Plant, and EquipmentWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost. At least annually, we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant, and equipment, considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives. Effective January 2023, the estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities were increased from 5 to 8 years. This change in estimate was applied prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2023.Assets are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired.Identified Intangible AssetsWe amortize acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives. Acquisition-related, in-process R&D assets represent the fair value of incomplete R&D projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition; initially, these are classified as in-process R&D and are not subject to amortization. Once these R&D projects are completed, the asset balances are transferred from in-process R&D to acquisition-related developed technology and are subject to amortization from that point forward. The asset balances relating to projects that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to R&D.We perform periodic reviews of significant finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. These reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Periodically, we also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. We may adjust the period over which these assets are amortized to reflect the period in which they contribute to our cash flows.GoodwillOur reporting units are the same as our operating segments. We evaluate our reporting units annually or when triggered, such as upon reorganization of our operating segments. We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The reporting unit's carrying value used in an impairment assessment represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. The impairment assessment may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.Qualitative factors used include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. We may also perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value.Our quantitative impairment assessment considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. Significant estimates include market segment growth rates, our assumed market segment share, estimated gross margins, operating expenses, and discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. These estimates change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors and could materially affect the determination of each reporting unit's fair value and potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Our quantitative assessment is sensitive to changes in underlying estimates and assumptions, the most sensitive of which is the discount rate. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements80Table of ContentsWe test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. In 2023, the fair value for all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value, and our annual qualitative assessment did not indicate that a more detailed quantitative analysis was necessary.Government IncentivesGovernment incentives, including cash grants and refundable tax credits, are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the incentive will be received and we will comply with the conditions specified in the agreement or statutory requirements. We record capital-related incentives as a reduction to property, plant, and equipment, net within our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize a reduction to depreciation expense over the useful life of the corresponding acquired asset. We record operating-related incentives as a reduction to expense in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the expenditure for which the incentive is intended to compensate.Fair ValueWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: ▪Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.▪Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.▪Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help confirm that the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.Debt InvestmentsDebt investments include investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. Unhedged debt investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalents. Unhedged debt investments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and all economically hedged debt investments are classified as short-term investments, as they represent the investment of cash available for current operations. For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument, or the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net. Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level and record the interest income and realized gains or losses on the sale of these investments in interest and other, net.Unhedged debt investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews. For investments in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists by considering information about the collectability of the instrument, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. We recognize an allowance for credit losses, up to the amount of the unrealized loss when appropriate, and write down the amortized cost basis of the investment if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in interest and other, net, and unrealized losses not related to credit losses are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements81Table of ContentsEquity InvestmentsWe regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows: ▪Marketable equity securities are equity securities with RDFV that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement. ▪Non-marketable equity securities are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes.▪Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss. Our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investments is recognized on a one-quarter lag.Realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted for qualifying observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches. ▪Non-marketable equity securities are tested for impairment using a qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and property, plant, and equipment. Upon determining that an impairment may exist, the security's fair value is calculated and compared to its carrying value, and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.▪Equity method investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews using the other-than-temporary impairment model, which considers the severity and duration of a decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery. Impairments of equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.Derivative Financial InstrumentsOur primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. For presentation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments, including related collateral amounts, are presented at fair value on a gross basis and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities.Cash flow hedges use foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards and currency interest rate swaps, to hedge exposures for variability in the US-dollar equivalent of non-US-dollar-denominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital purchases spending.The after-tax gains or losses from the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the impact of the hedge transaction. For foreign currency contracts hedging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, and are recognized in earnings in the same income statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the cash flow hedge transactions become improbable, the corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be immediately reclassified to interest and other, net. Cash flows associated with these derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item.Fair value hedges use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the offsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other, net. Cash flows associated with these derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within net cash provided by (used for) financing activities. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements82Table of ContentsNon-designated hedges use foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, and non-US-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as hedged investments. We also use interest rate contracts to hedge interest rate risk related to our US-dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt investments classified as hedged investments. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded through earnings in the line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income to which the derivatives most closely relate, primarily in interest and other, net. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives. Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, reverse repurchase agreements, and trade and other receivables. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty's relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy, substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December 30, 2023, our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding money market funds invested in US treasury and US agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed $1.6 billion. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our derivative counterparties and obtain and secure collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions when we deem it appropriate. Cash collateral exchanged under our collateral security arrangements is included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. For reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability unless the collateral is repledged.A substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to OEMs and ODMs. We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. We believe the net accounts receivable balances from our three largest customers (50% as of December 30, 2023) do not represent a significant credit risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.Variable Interest EntitiesWe have economic interests in entities that are VIEs. If we conclude we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we are required to consolidate the entity in our financial statements. To determine if we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide services to the VIE. Periodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.Non-Controlling InterestsOur Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of majority-owned subsidiaries consolidated under the variable interest and voting interest models. Non-controlling interests represent the portion of equity not attributable to Intel and are reported as a separate component of equity, net of tax and transaction costs, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for majority-owned subsidiaries are attributed to Intel and to non-controlling interest holders on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income based on respective ownership percentages. We account for changes in ownership of our majority-owned subsidiaries as equity transactions when we retain a controlling financial interest. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements83Table of ContentsBusiness CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments in determining the fair value of the following:▪inventory; property, plant, and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; and contingent consideration; each as may be applicable; ▪intangible assets, including the valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, and our assumed market segment share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;▪deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date; and▪goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies. These assumptions and estimates are used to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and to allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we may recognize adjustments to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and related goodwill.Employee Equity Incentive PlansWe use the straight-line amortization method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the service period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of RSUs, we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award.For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.Income TaxesWe compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is affected by management's plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, such changes could also affect our future provision for taxes.We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for (benefit from) taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income.We recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in US taxable income as a period cost. We have recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-US earnings or for outside basis differences in our subsidiaries, because we do not plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis differences. Remittances of non-US earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-US and US operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-US earnings, which could be subject to applicable non-US income and withholding taxes.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements84Table of ContentsLeasesLeases consist of real property and machinery and equipment. Our lease terms may include options to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. For leases for supplier capacity, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. For all other leases, we account for the lease and non-lease components separately and do not include the non-lease components in our leased assets and corresponding liabilities. Payments on leases may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are based on output of the underlying leased assets.Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims, liabilities related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business and are subject to change, including due to sudden or rapid developments in proceedings or claims. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously accrued liabilities, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Note 3 : Operating SegmentsWe previously announced the organizational change to integrate AXG into CCG and DCAI. This change is intended to drive a more effective go-to-market capability and to accelerate the scale of these businesses, while also reducing costs. As a result, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2023 to align to this and certain other business reorganizations. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODM internally receives information and manages and monitors our operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2023.We manage our business through the following operating segments:▪Client Computing Group▪Data Center and AI▪Network and Edge ▪Mobileye▪Intel Foundry ServicesWe derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture. CCG, DCAI, and NEX are our reportable operating segments. Mobileye and IFS do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment. We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments.We have an \"all other\" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:▪results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, and from start-up businesses that support our initiatives;▪historical results of operations from divested businesses; ▪amounts included within restructuring and other charges; ▪employee benefits, compensation, impairment charges, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and ▪acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information, and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, share-based compensation, or taxes to our operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements85Table of ContentsNet revenue and operating income (loss) for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Net revenue:Client ComputingDesktop$10,166 $10,661 $12,437 Notebook16,990 18,781 25,443 Other2,102 2,331 3,201 29,258 31,773 41,081 Data Center and AI$15,521 $19,445 $22,774 Network and Edge5,774 8,409 7,665 Mobileye2,079 1,869 1,386 Intel Foundry Services952 469 347 All other644 1,089 5,771 Total net revenue$54,228 $63,054 $79,024 Operating income (loss):Client Computing$6,520 $5,569 $15,523 Data Center and AI(530)1,300 7,376 Network and Edge(482)1,033 1,935 Mobileye664 690 554 Intel Foundry Services(482)(281)76 All other(5,597)(5,977)(6,008)Total operating income (loss)$93 $2,334 $19,456 In 2022, we initiated the wind-down of our Intel Optane memory business, which is part of our DCAI operating segment. While Intel Optane is a leading technology, it was not aligned to our strategic priorities. Separately, we continue to embrace the CXL standard. As a result, we recognized an inventory impairment of $723 million in cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2022. The impairment charge is recognized as a corporate charge in the \"all other\" category presented above. In 2023, substantially all of the revenue from our three largest customers was from the sale of platforms and other components by our CCG and DCAI operating segments.

Generally, contributions will be made to, and distributions will be received from, Arizona Fab based on both parties' proportional ownership. We will be the sole operator of two new chip factories that will be constructed by Arizona Fab, and we will have the right to purchase 100% of the related factory output. Once production commences, we will be required to operate Arizona Fab at minimum production levels measured in wafer starts per week and will be required to limit excess inventory held on site, or we will be subject to certain penalties.We have an unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of Arizona Fab of $29.0 billion.As of December 30, 2023, a substantial majority of the assets of Arizona Fab consisted of property, plant, and equipment. The assets held by Arizona Fab, which can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE and are not available to us, were $4.8 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022). MobileyeIn 2022, Mobileye completed its IPO and certain other equity financing transactions that resulted in net proceeds of $1.0 billion. During the second quarter of 2023, we converted 38.5 million of our Mobileye Class B shares into Class A shares, representing 5% of Mobileye's outstanding capital stock, and subsequently sold the Class A shares for $42 per share as part of a secondary offering, receiving net proceeds of $1.6 billion and increasing our capital in excess of par value by $663 million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of Mobileye into our consolidated financial statements. IMS Nanofabrication In the third and fourth quarters of 2023, we closed agreements to sell a combined 32% minority stake in our IMS business, a business within our IFS operating segment —including a 20% stake to Bain Capital and a 10% stake to TSMC. Net proceeds resulting from the minority stake sales totaled $1.4 billion, and our capital in excess of par value increased by $958 million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of IMS into our consolidated financial statements.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements87Table of ContentsNote 5 : Earnings Per ShareYears Ended (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Net income$1,675 $8,017 $19,868 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests(14)3 — Net income attributable to Intel$1,689 $8,014 $19,868 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding—basic4,190 4,108 4,059 Dilutive effect of employee incentive plans22 15 31 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding—diluted4,212 4,123 4,090 Earnings per share attributable to Intel—basic$0.40 $1.95 $4.89 Earnings per share attributable to Intel—diluted$0.40 $1.94 $4.86 We computed diluted earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the 2006 ESPP.During 2022, 70 million RSUs and stock options, as calculated on a weighted average basis for the year, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in the table above because they would have been anti-dilutive. These RSUs and options could potentially be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation in the future if the average market value of the common shares increases above the exercise price. For all other periods presented, securities that would have been anti-dilutive were insignificant and have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.Note 6 : Other Financial Statement DetailsAccounts ReceivableWe sell certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. We record these transactions as sales of receivables and present cash proceeds as cash flows provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Accounts receivable sold under non-recourse factoring arrangements were $2.0 billion during 2023 and $665 million during 2022. After the sale of our accounts receivable, we expect to collect payment from the customers and remit it to the third-party financial institution.Inventories(In Millions)Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Raw materials$1,166 $1,517 Work in process6,203 7,565 Finished goods3,758 4,142 Total inventories$11,127 $13,224  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements88Table of ContentsProperty, Plant, and Equipment(In Millions)Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Land and buildings$51,182 $44,808 Machinery and equipment100,033 92,711 Construction in progress43,442 36,727 Total property, plant, and equipment, gross194,657 174,246 Less: Accumulated depreciation(98,010)(93,386)Total property, plant, and equipment, net$96,647 $80,860 Our depreciable property, plant, and equipment assets are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 3 to 8 years; and buildings, 10 to 25 years. Effective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 to 8 years. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, we estimate this change increased gross margin in 2023 by approximately $2.5 billion and decreased R&D expense by approximately $400 million. As of December 30, 2023, we estimate this change decreased ending inventory values by approximately $1.3 billion. These estimates are based on the assets in use and under construction as of the beginning of 2023 and are calculated at that point in time.Net property, plant, and equipment by country at the end of each period was as follows:(In Millions)Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022United States$63,234 $53,681 Ireland16,746 13,179 Israel9,290 7,908 Other countries7,377 6,092 Total property, plant, and equipment, net$96,647 $80,860  Government IncentivesWe enter into government incentive arrangements with local, regional, and national governments, both US and non-US. These arrangements vary in size, duration, and conditions and allow us to maintain a market-comparable foothold across various geographies. These incentives are primarily structured as cash grants and refundable tax credits. Capital-related incentives have terms of up to 15 years and operating-related incentives have terms that can vary widely. We are eligible to receive these incentives because we engage in qualifying capital investments, R&D, and other activities as defined by the relevant government entities. This includes qualifying capital investments for semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging manufacturing facilities construction and acquisition of equipment. Each incentive requires that we comply with certain conditions for a period that may exceed the incentive terms. These conditions can include achievement of future operational targets and committing to minimum levels of capital investment. If conditions are not satisfied, the incentives may be subject to reduction, recapture, or termination.Capital-related incentives reduced gross property, plant, and equipment by $5.5 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($3.3 billion as of December 31, 2022), of which $2.2 billion was recognized in 2023 ($373 million in 2022). Capital-related incentives reduced depreciation expense by $226 million in 2023, of which substantially all reduced cost of sales ($230 million in 2022, all of which reduced cost of sales). Related incentives recognized during each period consisted of the following:▪US federal government pursuant to the US CHIPS and Science Act - We recognized a non-cash refundable advanced manufacturing investment tax credit of $845 million in 2023, which is recorded as an offset to income taxes payable. No incentives were recognized in 2022.▪US state governments - We recognized $723 million of grants in 2023 related to two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio. No incentives were recognized in 2022.▪Non-US governments - We recognized $645 million of grants and refundable tax credits in 2023 ($373 million in 2022), a majority of which related to the expansion of silicon wafer manufacturing facilities in Ireland.Operating-related incentives benefited operating income by $202 million in 2023 ($104 million in 2022), a majority of which was recorded in cost of sales. Capital-related and operating-related grants receivables totaled $559 million as of December 30, 2023 ($437 million as of December 31, 2022), a majority of which pertained to capital-related grants and were recognized as non-cash investing activities. A substantial majority of the grants receivables were recorded within other long-term assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 30, 2023 and as of December 31, 2022. Capital-related refundable tax credits totaled $365 million as of December 30, 2023 (no balance as of December 31, 2022) and were recorded within income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements89Table of ContentsOther Accrued LiabilitiesOther accrued liabilities include deferred compensation of $2.9 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($2.4 billion as of December 31, 2022).AdvertisingAdvertising costs, including direct marketing, are expensed as incurred and recorded within MG&A expenses.

The statutory tax rates in these jurisdictions range from 12.5% to 24.0%. We are subject to reduced tax rates in Israel and Malaysia as long as we conduct certain eligible activities and make certain capital investments. We have conditional reduced tax rates that expire at various dates through 2056, and we expect to apply for renewals upon expiration.

Interest, penalties, and accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in the periods presented.We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain US federal and non-US tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 30, 2023 could decrease by as much as $314 million in the next 12 months. We file federal, state, and non-US tax returns. We are no longer subject to US federal and non-US tax examinations for years prior to 2018 and 2015, respectively. For US state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2015.Note 9 : InvestmentsShort-term InvestmentsShort-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments, and are recorded within cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bills and bonds and US agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, substantially all time deposits were issued by institutions outside the US. The fair value of our economically hedged marketable debt investments was $17.1 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($16.2 billion as of December 31, 2022). For hedged investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net gains of $534 million in 2023 (net losses of $748 million in 2022 and net losses of $606 million in 2021). Net losses on the related derivatives were $472 million in 2023 (net gains of $752 million in 2022 and net gains of $609 million in 2021).Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

(SK hynix) to divest our NAND memory business for $9.0 billion in cash. Our NAND memory business includes our NAND memory technology and manufacturing business (the NAND OpCo Business), of which we deconsolidated our ongoing interests as part of the sale. The transaction will be completed in two closings and upon the first closing in the first quarter of 2022, SK hynix paid $7.0 billion of consideration and we recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.0 billion within interest and other, net, and tax expense of $495 million. We recorded a receivable in other long-term assets for the remaining proceeds we will receive upon the second closing of the transaction, expected to be no earlier than March 2025. The receivable outstanding was $2.0 billion as of December 30, 2023 and $1.9 billion December 31, 2022. The wafer manufacturing and sale agreement includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of the NAND OpCo Business. These incentives and penalties present a maximum exposure of up to $500 million annually, and $1.5 billion in the aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update the operating plan of the NAND OpCo Business in light of the current business environment and projections, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and penalties and our expectations of the performance of the NAND OpCo Business against those metrics.We were reimbursed for costs that we incurred on behalf of the NAND OpCo Business for corporate function services, which include human resources, information technology, finance, supply chain, and other compliance requirements. Reimbursed expenses approximated $145 million in 2022 and $125 million in 2023. We recorded a receivable due from the NAND OpCo Business, a deconsolidated entity, of $145 million within other current assets as of December 30, 2023 ($133 million recorded as of December 31, 2022).

The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. For the benefit of eligible US employees, we also provide an unfunded non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees. We expensed $272 million in 2023, $489 million in 2022, and $444 million in 2021 for matching contributions based on the amount of employee contributions under the US qualified defined contribution and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. The matching contribution in the US qualified defined contribution plan was reduced from March 1 through December 31, 2023. US Retiree Medical PlanUpon retirement, we provide certain benefits to eligible US employees who were hired prior to 2014 under the US Retiree Medical Plan. The benefits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase eligible coverage in a medical plan.As of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the projected benefit obligation was $490 million and $527 million, which used the discount rates of 5.3% and 5.6%. The December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 corresponding fair value of plan assets was $548 million and $501 million. As of December 30, 2023, the US Retiree Medical Plan was in the net asset position.The investment strategy for US Retiree Medical Plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The assets are invested in tax-aware global equity and fixed-income long credit portfolios. Both portfolios are actively managed by external managers. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries. The tax-aware fixed-income long credit portfolio is composed of domestic securities. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 45% equity and 55% fixed-income investments. As of December 30, 2023, the majority of the US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. The remaining US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in fixed-income investments and were measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs.As of December 30, 2023, the estimated benefit payments for this plan over the next 10 years are as follows: (In Millions)202420252026202720282029-2033Postretirement medical benefits$34 $35 $35 $35 $36 $187 Pension Benefit PlansWe provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain countries, most significantly Ireland, the US, Germany and Israel. The majority of the plans' benefits have been frozen. Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets for Pension Benefit PlansThe vested benefit obligation for a defined-benefit pension plan is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is currently entitled based on the employee's expected date of separation or retirement. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements103Table of Contents (In Millions)Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Changes in projected benefit obligation:Beginning projected benefit obligation$2,705 $4,456 Service cost36 58 Interest cost127 91 Actuarial (gain) loss57 (1,500)Currency exchange rate changes38 (233)Plan settlements(103)(96)Other(35)(71)Ending projected benefit obligation12,825 2,705 Changes in fair value of plan assets:Beginning fair value of plan assets2,130 2,817 Actual return on plan assets151 (478)Currency exchange rate changes34 (102)Plan settlements(103)(96)Other— (11)Ending fair value of plan assets22,212 2,130 Net unfunded status$613 $575 Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance SheetsOther long-term assets$62 $74 Other long-term liabilities$675 $649 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (income), before tax3$410 $406 Accumulated benefit obligation$2,706 $2,507 1    The projected benefit obligation was approximately 30% in the US and 70% outside of the US as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.2    The fair value of plan assets was approximately 40% in the US and 60% outside of the US as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.3    The accumulated other comprehensive loss (income), before tax, was approximately 70% in the US and 30% outside of the US as of December 30, 2023 (approximately 90% in the US and 10% outside of the US as of December 31, 2022). Changes in actuarial gains and losses in the projected benefit obligation are generally driven by discount rate movement. We use the corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line basis.As of December 30, 2023, the accumulated benefit obligations were $0.8 billion and $1.9 billion for the US plan and non-US plans, respectively. As of December 30, 2023, the US plan was in the net asset position and the other non-US plans had projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. As of December 31, 2022, the accumulated benefit obligations were $0.9 billion and $1.6 billion for the US plan and non-US plans, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the US and Ireland plans were in the net asset position and the other non-US plans had projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. As of December 31, 2022, the US, Ireland, and Israel plans had assets in excess of accumulated benefit obligations, whereas the remaining non-US plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.

We establish the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class.FundingOur practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and regulations. Funding for the US Retiree Medical Plan is discretionary under applicable laws and regulations. Additional funding may be provided for the pension and retiree medical plans as deemed appropriate.On a worldwide basis, our pension and retiree medical plans were 83% funded as of December 30, 2023. The US Pension Plan, which accounts for 26% of the worldwide pension and retiree medical benefit obligations, was 107% funded. Funded status is not indicative of our ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to fund retirement trusts. Required pension funding for US retirement plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, which sets required minimum contributions. Cumulative company funding to the US Pension Plan currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding requirements.Net Periodic Benefit CostThe net periodic benefit cost for pension and US retiree medical benefits was $107 million in 2023 ($139 million in 2022 and $162 million in 2021).

The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 91% fixed income and 9% equity investments. During 2023, the US Pension Plan assets were invested in collective investment trust funds, which are measured at net asset value.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements105Table of ContentsNon-US Plan AssetsThe investments of the non-US plans are managed by insurance companies, pension funds, or third-party trustees, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have the discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, either through index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and to help enable sufficient pension assets to be available to pay benefits as they come due. The equity investments in the non-US plan assets are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the US, and emerging markets throughout the world. We have control over the investment strategy related to the majority of the assets measured at net asset value, which are invested in hedge funds, bond index funds, and equity index funds. The target allocation of the non-US plan assets that we have control over was approximately 40% fixed income, 40% equity, and 20% hedge fund investments in 2023.Estimated Future Benefit Payments for Pension Benefit PlansAs of December 30, 2023, estimated benefit payments over the next 10 years are as follows:(In Millions)202420252026202720282029-2033Pension benefits$95 $97 $101 $106 $109 $638 Note 18 : Employee Equity Incentive PlansOur equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. Our plans include our 2006 Plan and our 2006 ESPP.Under the 2006 Plan, 1.1 billion shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through June 2026. As of December 30, 2023, 194 million shares of common stock remained available for future grants.Under the 2006 Plan, we may grant RSUs and stock options. We grant RSUs with a service condition as well as RSUs with a market condition, performance condition, and a service condition, which we call PSUs. PSUs are granted to a group of senior officers and employees. For PSUs granted in 2023 and 2022, the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting at the end of the three-year performance period will range from 0% to 200% of the target grant amount. The PSU payout will be determined based on our performance (i) relative to annual targets for each year in the performance period with respect to a revenue growth metric, weighted 60%, and a cash flow from operations metric, weighted 40%, which results are then averaged at the end of the three-year performance period; and (ii) as may be adjusted by two equally weighted modifiers: the TSR of our common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of above median of the S&P 500 Index over a three-year period and revenue CAGR for the three-year performance period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. For 2023 PSUs, overall payout will be capped at target grant amount if our absolute TSR is negative. As of December 30, 2023, 16 million PSUs were outstanding. PSUs vest three years and one month following the start of the performance period. Other RSU awards and option awards generally vest over four years from the grant date. Share-Based CompensationShare-based compensation recognized in 2023 was $3.2 billion ($3.1 billion in 2022 and $2.0 billion in 2021). During 2023, the tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $571 million ($478 million in 2022 and $377 million in 2021).We estimate the fair value of RSUs and PSUs with a service condition or performance condition using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our shares of common stock prior to vesting. We estimate the fair value of PSUs with a market condition using a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the date of grant using historical volatility.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements106Table of ContentsRestricted Stock Units and Performance Stock UnitsWeighted average assumptions used in estimating grant values were as follows:Dec 30, 2023Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Estimated values$28.92 $41.12 $50.82 Risk-free interest rate4.7 %2.2 %0.2 %Dividend yield1.6 %3.4 %2.6 %Volatility36 %40 %37 %Summary of activities:Number of Stock Units Outstanding (In Millions)Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair ValueDecember 31, 2022$158.7 $45.56 Granted$98.2 $28.92 Vested$(63.6)$43.22 Forfeited$(20.4)$44.87 December 30, 2023$172.9 $37.05 Expected to vest$153.9 $37.45 The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2023 was $2.2 billion ($2.0 billion in 2022 and $1.7 billion in 2021), which represents the market value of our common stock on the date that the RSUs vested. The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2023 was $2.7 billion ($2.5 billion in 2022 and $1.4 billion in 2021). The number of RSUs vested includes shares of common stock that we withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. RSUs that are expected to vest are net of estimated future forfeitures.As of December 30, 2023, unrecognized compensation costs related to RSUs granted under our equity incentive plans were $4.0 billion. We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.Stock Purchase PlanThe 2006 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. Under the 2006 ESPP, 523 million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance through August 2026. As of December 30, 2023, 157 million shares of common stock remained available for issuance.Employees purchased 43 million shares of common stock in 2023 for $1.0 billion under the 2006 ESPP (27 million shares of common stock for $931 million in 2022 and 22 million shares of common stock for $925 million in 2021). As of December 30, 2023, unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire shares of common stock under the 2006 ESPP totaled $57 million. We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately two months. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements107Table of ContentsNote 19 : Commitments and ContingenciesLeasesWe recognized operating leased assets in other long-term assets of $505 million and corresponding accrued liabilities of $142 million, and other long-term liabilities of $289 million as of December 30, 2023. Our operating leases have remaining terms of 1 to 13 years and may include options to extend the leases for up to 38 years. The weighted average remaining lease term was 6.0 years, and the weighted average discount rate was 5.0% as of December 30, 2023, for our operating leases. Operating lease expense was $407 million in 2023 ($729 million in 2022 and $798 million in 2021), including $213 million in variable lease expense in 2023 ($551 million in 2022 and $620 million in 2021).In 2022 and 2021, we signed finance leases for supplier capacity. The leases will commence upon start of supplier production and will have a weighted average remaining lease term of 6.0 years upon commencement. We recognized finance leased assets in property, plant, and equipment of $619 million as of December 30, 2023 ($430 million as of December 31, 2022).Discounted and undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable leases as of December 30, 2023 were as follows:(In Millions)20242025202620272028 ThereafterTotalOperating lease payments$149 $110 $62 $44 $31 $103 $499 Finance lease payments$480 $70 $— $— $— $— $550 Present value of lease payments$978 CommitmentsCommitments for capital expenditures totaled $27.5 billion as of December 30, 2023, ($31.0 billion as of December 31, 2022), a substantial majority of which will be due within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $8.3 billion as of December 30, 2023 (approximately $10.7 billion as of December 31, 2022). Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under supply agreements and various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services relate to agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Other purchase obligations reflect the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee under the agreement. Other purchase commitments also include our unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of $29.0 billion of Arizona Fab in connection with the definitive agreement entered into with Brookfield. Our remaining unfunded contribution was $12.3 billion as of December 30, 2023. Legal ProceedingsWe are regularly party to various ongoing claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including those noted in this section. As of December 30, 2023, we have accrued a charge of $1.0 billion related to litigation involving VLSI and a charge of $401 million related to an EC-imposed fine, both as described below. Excluding the VLSI claims described below, management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate monetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time. European Commission Competition MatterIn 2009, the EC found that we had used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy microprocessors in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty (later renumbered Article 102) and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 by offering alleged “conditional rebates and payments” that required customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged “payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.” The EC ordered us to end the alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a €1.1 billion fine, which we paid in the third quarter of 2009.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements108Table of ContentsWe appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) rejected our appeal of the EC decision in its entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. In January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC’s 2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the €1.1 billion fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to us in February 2022. The General Court’s January 2022 decision did not annul the EC’s 2009 finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.In April 2022, the EC appealed the General Court’s decision to the Court of Justice. In addition, in September 2023 the EC imposed a €376 million ($401 million) fine against us based on its finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products. We have appealed the EC’s decision. We have accrued a charge for the fine and are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses in excess of this amount given the procedural posture and the nature of these proceedings. In a related matter, in April 2022 we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the EC to pay us approximately €593 million in default interest on the original €1.1 billion fine that was held by the EC for 12 years, which applications have been stayed pending the EC’s appeal of the General Court’s January 2022 decision.Litigation Related to Security VulnerabilitiesIn June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, the first variants of which are now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available.As of January 24, 2024, consumer class action lawsuits against us were pending in the US, Canada, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by our actions and/or omissions in connection with Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of this class of security vulnerabilities that have been identified since 2018, and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the US, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the US District Court for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor of Intel in July 2022 based on plaintiffs’ failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs appealed, and in November 2023 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s judgment. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case relating to Spectre and Meltdown pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, and a stay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect. In Argentina, Intel Argentina was served with, and responded to, a class action complaint relating to Spectre and Meltdown in June 2022. The Argentinian court dismissed plaintiffs’ claims for lack of standing in May 2023, and plaintiffs have appealed. In November 2023, new plaintiffs filed a consumer class action complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California with respect to a further vulnerability variant disclosed in August 2023 and commonly referred to as “Downfall.” We moved to dismiss that complaint in January 2024. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these matters. Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay AnnouncementMultiple securities class action lawsuits were filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain officers following our July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs in October 2020, and in January 2021 plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Plaintiffs purport to represent all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock from October 25, 2019 through October 23, 2020, and they generally allege that defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products. In March 2023, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and in April 2023 entered judgment. Plaintiffs have appealed. Given the procedural posture and the nature of the case, including that it is in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from the matter. In July 2021, we introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now called Intel 4.Litigation Related to Patent and IP ClaimsWe have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements109Table of ContentsVLSI Technology LLC v. Intel In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against us in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that various Intel FPGA and processor products infringe eight patents VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). VLSI granted Intel a covenant not to sue on the two patents the court said can proceed to trial as it appeals losses it suffered earlier in the case on three other patents. VLSI has requested that the judge take the trial scheduled for March 2024 off calendar.  In April 2019, VLSI filed three infringement suits against us in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas accusing various of our processors of infringement of eight additional patents it had acquired from NXP:▪The first Texas case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded VLSI $1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent and $675 million for infringement of another patent under the doctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding VLSI $2.1 billion in damages and approximately $162.3 million in pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. We appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including the court’s rejection of Intel’s claim to have a license from Fortress Investment Group’s acquisition of Finjan. The Federal Circuit Court heard oral argument in October 2023. In December 2023, the Federal Circuit reversed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI was awarded $675 million. The Federal Circuit affirmed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI had been awarded $1.5 billion, but vacated the damages award and will send the case back to the trial court for further damages proceedings on that patent. The Federal Circuit also ruled that Intel can advance the defense that it is licensed to VLSI’s patents. In December 2021 and January 2022 the PTAB instituted IPRs on the claims found to have been infringed in the first Texas case, and in May and June 2023 found all of those claims unpatentable; VLSI has appealed the PTAB’s decision.▪The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that we do not infringe the asserted patents. VLSI had sought approximately $3.0 billion for alleged infringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet entered final judgment. ▪The third Texas case went to trial in November 2022, with VLSI asserting one remaining patent. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, and awarded VLSI approximately $949 million in damages, plus interest and a running royalty. The court has not yet entered final judgment. In February 2023, we filed motions for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law notwithstanding the verdict on various grounds. Further appeals are possible.In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserted one patent against certain Intel Core processors. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) which held a hearing in September 2021. The Shenzhen court held trial proceedings in July 2021, and September 2023. VLSI sought an injunction as well as RMB 1.3 million in costs and expenses, but no damages. In September 2023, the CNIPA invalidated every claim of the asserted patent. In November 2023, the trial court dismissed VLSI’s case.In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. asserting one patent against certain Intel core processors. The court held a trial hearing in December 2020, where VLSI requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an injunction. In December 2022, we filed a petition to invalidate the patent at issue. The court held a second trial hearing in May 2022, and in October 2023, issued a decision finding no infringement and dismissing all claims. In November 2023, VLSI appealed the finding of non-infringement.As a result of recent developments in the VLSI litigation, we revised our loss exposure estimate and reduced our previously accrued  charge of $2.2 billion to approximately $1.0 billion. While we dispute VLSI’s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts given recent developments and future proceedings. R2 Semiconductor Patent LitigationIn November 2022, R2 Semiconductor, Inc. (R2) filed a lawsuit in the High Court of Justice in the UK against Intel Corporation (UK) Limited and Intel Corporation, and a lawsuit in the Dusseldorf Regional Court in Germany against Intel Deutschland GmbH and certain Intel customers. R2 asserts one European patent is infringed by Intel’s Ice Lake, Tiger Lake, Alder Lake and Ice Lake Server (Xeon) processors (the accused products), and customer servers and laptops that contain those processors. R2 seeks an injunction in both actions prohibiting the sale and requiring the recall of the alleged infringing products. Intel is indemnifying its customers in the German lawsuit.Intel disputes R2’s claims and intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously. In December 2022, Intel responded in the UK action that the asserted patent is not infringed and that the patent is invalid. In April 2023, defendants filed statements of defense in the German action that the asserted patent is not infringed and that an injunction would be a disproportionate remedy. In May 2023, defendants also filed a nullity action in the German Federal Patent Court on the ground that the asserted patent is invalid. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements110Table of ContentsIn December 2023, the German Federal Patent Court issued a preliminary opinion finding R2’s patent valid. The German Federal Patent Court’s final decision on invalidity is expected in October 2024. In December 2023, the court in Dusseldorf held a trial on the issue of infringement, and will hand down a decision in February 2024. If defendants lose at trial in Germany, the Dusseldorf Regional Court could impose an injunction and recall order prohibiting sales of some or all of the accused products, and potentially other products, in Germany. The order could take effect and remain in place unless overturned on appeal, or unless the patent is invalidated by the German Federal Patent Court.Trial in the UK matter is scheduled for April 2024. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved and that uncertainty exists as to the scope of an injunction, if any, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these lawsuits.Business Interruption Insurance ProceedsWe received $484 million of insurance proceeds, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2022, to compensate for business interruption and property damage from a temporary electrical breakdown that occurred at one of our facilities in 2020. We recognized these receipts as a reduction of cost of sales.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements111Table of ContentsKey TermsWe use terms throughout our document that are specific to Intel or that are abbreviations that may not be commonly known or used.

A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on management's evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with US GAAP.Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Management's assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment.Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP. We reviewed the results of management's assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting, as stated in the firm's attestation report, which is included within Financial Statements and Supplemental Details.

CCG revenue was down on lower notebook and desktop volume in the consumer and education market segments, while notebook and desktop ASPs were higher due to a resulting change in product mix. DCAI server volume decreased, led by enterprise customers, and due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories in a softening data center market. Server ASPs decreased due to customer and product mix. NEX revenue increased primarily due to Ethernet ASPs and increased demand for 5G products, partially offset by lower demand for Network Xeon. We invested $17.5 billion in R&D, made capital investments of $24.8 billion, and generated $15.4 billion in cash from operations and $(4.1) billion of adjusted free cash flow.RevenueGross MarginDiluted EPS Attributable to IntelCash Flows■ GAAP $B  ■ Non-GAAP $B■ GAAP ■ Non-GAAP■ GAAP ■ Non-GAAP■ Operating Cash Flow $B■ Adjusted Free Cash Flow1 $B$63.1B42.6%47.3%$1.94$1.84$15.4B$(4.1)BGAAPGAAPnon-GAAP1GAAPnon-GAAP1GAAPnon-GAAP1Revenue down 16% from 2021 non-GAAP revenueGross margin down 12.8 ppts from 2021Gross margin down 10.8 ppts from 2021Diluted EPS down $2.92 or 60% from 2021 Diluted EPS down $3.46 or 65% from 2021Operating cash flow down $14B or 48%Adjusted free cash flow down $15B or 137%Lower revenue in CCG and DCAI, higher revenue in NEX, and lack of NAND revenue compared to 2021 due to the divestiture in Q1 2022.Lower gross margin from lower revenue, higher unit cost, lack of NAND gross margin, higher period charges from the ramp of Intel 4, and higher inventory reserves.Lower EPS from lower gross margin, higher operating expenses from additional investment in R&D, partially offset by higher gains on equity investments and a tax benefit. Lower operating cash flow driven by lower operating income; partially offset by favorable working capitalchanges.Managing to our long-term financial modelOur 2022 results were impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic environment arising from inflation, the war in Ukraine, and COVID-19 shutdowns in our supply chain in China, and though we expect this uncertainty and a challenging market environment to extend well into 2023, we remain committed to the strategy and long-term financial model communicated at our Investor Meeting 2022 as included in our Form 8-K dated February 17, 2022. To achieve our long-term financial model, we believe it is imperative that we drive to world-class product cost and operational efficiency. In the short term, we intend to continue to implement certain cost-cutting measures and improve our product execution. We further expect to manage to the investment phase operating expenses and net capital intensity guardrails established at our Investor Meeting 2022 and to drive back to a gross margin range of 51% to 53%, once economic conditions improve and revenue growth returns. Longer term, we plan to execute multiple initiatives designed to optimize the business, thus creating efficiencies and continued structural cost savings. This includes implementing an internal foundry model, making portfolio cuts, right sizing our support organizations, creating more stringent cost controls across our spending, and improving sales and marketing efficiency. Though we aggressively adjusted capital investments in 2022 to respond to changing business conditions, we still made significant investments in support of our IDM 2.0 strategy during the year. We expect our capital expenditures will continue to be higher than historical levels for the next several years as we execute towards our goal of delivering five technology nodes in four years. We also introduced our IDM 2.0 Acceleration Office to transition our operations to an internal foundry model that is designed to deliver consistent processes, systems, and guardrails among our business units, and design and manufacturing teams, which we expect will allow us to improve structural efficiencies by driving accountability and costs back to decision makers within the company.1  See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&A.Fundamentals of Our Business5Table of ContentsDelivering leadership productsWe seek to develop and offer leading products that will help enable a future in which every human can have more computing power and quicker access to data. We remain committed to our goal of delivering five technology nodes in four years. This year, we achieved several key milestones on our product roadmap, including:  ▪We launched the 12th Gen Intel® Core™ HX processors—the final products in our Alder Lake family, which utilize desktop-caliber silicon in a mobile package to deliver high levels of performance for professional workflows. ▪We introduced the Intel® Data Center GPU Flex Series for the intelligent visual cloud and revealed the 13th Gen Intel® Core™ processor family with six new unlocked desktop processors for leading gaming, streaming, and recording experiences.▪We launched the newest Intel® Xeon® D processors and Intel® Arc™ A-series GPUs (also known as Alchemist), and began shipping Mount Evans, a 200G ASIC IPU, as well as the first Intel® Blockscale™ ASIC. ▪We began high-volume manufacturing of Sapphire Rapids, Raptor Lake, and Ponte Vecchio in 2022, with shipments beginning in Q4 2022.Investing in at-scale manufacturingTo help accelerate our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are investing in manufacturing capacity around the world. We broke ground on two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio, initially announcing plans to invest more than $20.0 billion to establish the first advanced semiconductor campus in the “Silicon Heartland”. We also announced our plans to invest up to €80.0 billion in the European Union over the next decade across the semiconductor value chain—from R&D to manufacturing to state-of-the-art packaging technologies. These include a plan to invest up to an initial €17.0 billion to build a leading-edge semiconductor fab mega-site in Germany; to create a new R&D and design hub in France; and to invest in R&D, manufacturing, and foundry services in Ireland, Italy, Poland, and Spain.To create further financial flexibility while we accelerate our strategy, we announced SCIP, a program that introduces a new funding model to the capital-intensive semiconductor industry. As part of this program, we closed a definitive agreement with Brookfield Asset Management (Brookfield), creating an equity partnership whereby we and Brookfield own 51% and 49%, respectively, of the newly formed entity, Arizona Fab LLC (Arizona Fab). We expect Arizona Fab will invest up to $30.0 billion in expanded manufacturing infrastructure at our Ocotillo campus in Chandler, Arizona.We also look to acquisitions to supplement and strengthen our capital. In Q1 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (Tower) in a cash-for-stock transaction. Tower is a leading foundry for analog semiconductor solutions. The acquisition is expected to advance our IDM 2.0 strategy by accelerating our global end-to-end foundry business. While we continue to work to close within the first quarter of 2023, the transaction may close in the first half of 2023, subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.Strengthening focus on the core businessWe reorganized our business units in a way that is designed to accelerate the execution and innovation of our company by allowing us to capture long-term growth in both large traditional markets and high-growth emerging markets, while providing increased transparency, focus, and accountability.We announced the implementation of cost-cutting measures, including a slower pace of hiring and restructuring actions, designed to reduce operating expenditures and manage the business toward our long-term financial strategy.We completed the IPO of Mobileye, building on Mobileye’s revenue growth and record of innovation and unlocking value for Intel stockholders.Committing to positive global impactIn April 2022, we announced our commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across our global operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2040 and to increase the energy efficiency and lower the carbon footprint of our products and platforms. Fundamentals of Our Business6Table of ContentsOur StrategyThe entire world is becoming digital as technology is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence. As we look ahead to the next decade, we expect to see continued movement to digital for everything—the way we work, learn, connect, develop, and operate. Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering the digitization of everything, and this is being accelerated by five superpowers: ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. Together these superpowers combine to amplify, and reinforce each other, and will exponentially increase the world’s need for computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever-smaller microchips. We intend to lead the industry by harnessing these superpowers for our customers’ growth and our own.We are uniquely positioned with the depth and breadth of our software, silicon and platforms, and packaging and process technology with at-scale manufacturing. With these strengths and the tailwinds of the superpowers driving digital disruption, our strategy to win is focused on four key themes: product leadership, open platforms, manufacturing at scale, and our people. Our PrioritiesProduct LeadershipLead and democratize compute with Intel x86 and xPU. Our product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from edge computing to 5G networks, the cloud, and the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, to serve an increasingly smart and connected world.At our core is the x86 computing ecosystem, which supports an extensive and deep universe of software applications, with billions of lines of code written and optimized for x86 CPUs. We continue to advance this ecosystem with x86 microarchitectures focused on performance, which push the limits of low latency and single-threaded application performance, and microarchitectures focused on efficiency, which are designed for computing throughput efficiency to enable scalable multithreaded performance. Our innovative new 13th Gen client processors (Raptor Lake) combine both performance cores and efficient cores in a performance hybrid architecture that can direct workloads to the right core depending on whether they require higher performance or power efficiency. We can also combine these architectural advances with our innovations in process and packaging technology, as in our next-generation Intel Xeon data center CPU (Sapphire Rapids), which utilizes performance cores on multiple compute tiles connected through our EMIB packaging technology in a scalable design, rather than being built on a monolithic silicon die. Beyond the CPU, we are delivering a growing family of xPU products, which encompass client and data center GPUs, IPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. The xPU approach recognizes that different workloads benefit from different computing architectures, and our broad portfolio helps meet our customers' increasingly diverse computing needs. As part of our strategy, we seek to develop and offer leading products across each of these architectural categories. Our vision is that our products will help enable a future in which every human can have one petaflop of computing power and one petabyte of data less than one millisecond away.Fundamentals of Our Business7Table of ContentsOpen PlatformsWe aim to deliver open software and hardware platforms with industry-defining standards. Around the globe, companies are building their networks, systems, and solutions on open standards-based platforms. Intel has helped set the stage for this movement, with our historic contributions in developing standards such as CXL, Thunderbolt™, and PCI Express* (PCIe*). We also contributed to the design, build, and validation of open-source products in the industry such as Linux*, Android*, and others. The world's developers constantly innovate and expand the capabilities of these open platforms while increasing their stability, reliability, and security. In addition, microservices have enabled the development of flexible, loosely coupled services that are connected via application programming interfaces to create end-to-end processes. We use industry collaboration, co-engineering, and open-source contributions to accelerate software innovation. Through our oneAPI initiative, developers use a unified language across CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs to cut down on development time and to enhance productivity. We also deliver a steady stream of open-source code and optimizations for projects across virtually every platform and usage model. We are committed to co-engineering and jointly designing, building, and validating new products with software industry leaders to accelerate mutual technology advancements and help new software and hardware work better together. Our commitment extends to developers through our developer-first approach based on openness, choice, and trust. Ultimately, we believe our pivot to a software-defined, silicon-enhanced strategy will enable us to realize value at all layers of the stack. This should allow us to continue to monetize foundational and ecosystem enabling software through hardware sales, limited licensing, and customer-enabling service offerings. Additionally, we intend to expand our software portfolio by developing and monetizing software solutions, services, and platforms with SaaS, software subscriptions, and other business models. We expect to focus on applied AI, trust and security, and cloud performance for our SaaS and subscription-based software and we plan to launch our first security SaaS product, Project Amber (an independent attestation service), in 2023.Manufacturing at Scale IDM 2.0, the next evolution and expansion of our IDM model, is a differentiated strategy that combines three capabilities:Internal factory network. Our global, internal factory network has been foundational to our success, enabling product optimization, improved economics, and supply resilience. We intend to remain a leading developer of process technology and a major manufacturer of semiconductors and will continue to build the majority of our products in our factories.Strategic use of foundry capacity. We expect to expand our use of third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, which will provide us with increased flexibility and scale to optimize our product roadmaps for cost, performance, schedule, and supply. Our use of foundry capacity will include manufacturing for a range of modular tiles on advanced process technologies. System foundry. We are building a world-class foundry business to meet the growing long-term global demand for semiconductors. We plan to differentiate our foundry offerings from those of others through a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe available for customers globally, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other ecosystem IP. The current foundry model enabled explosion of ecosystem innovation at the wafer level. We believe this established model has historically served the industry well, but a new mindset is needed in our new era of chipmaking. As innovation evolves, we see the rack has collapsed into a system and the system has collapsed into an advanced package. We are building out a system foundry that has four components: wafer fabrication, packaging, chiplet standard, and software.The system foundry involves engaging with customers at multiple levels, from basic wafer manufacturing to helping define and implement their desired system architecture. We intend to build our customers' silicon designs and deliver full end-to-end customizable products built with our advanced packaging technology. We believe our IDM 2.0 strategy enables us to deliver leading process technology and products to meet growing long-term demand using internal and external capacity, while leveraging our core strengths to provide foundry services to others and providing superior capacity, supply resilience, and an advantageous cost structure.Our PeopleOur world-class talent is at the heart of everything we do. Together we strive to have a positive effect on business, society, and the planet. Delivering on our strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent from across the world. Our people build our technology, unlock new business opportunities, and work with our partners and customers to create global impact.  Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace where the world’s best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet.Growth ImperativeWe are investing to position the company for accelerated long-term growth, focusing on both our core businesses and our growth businesses. In our client and server businesses, our strategy is to invest to strengthen the competitiveness of our product roadmap and to explore new opportunities. We believe we have significant opportunities to grow and gain share in graphics; mobility, including autonomous driving; networking and edge; and foundry services. Fundamentals of Our Business8Table of ContentsFocus on Innovation and ExecutionWe are focused on executing our product and process roadmap and accelerating our cadence of innovation. We have set a detailed process and packaging technology roadmap and announced key architectural innovations to further our goal of delivering leadership products in every area in which we compete. We are returning our culture to its roots in innovation and execution, drawing on principles established by our former CEO Andy Grove that emphasize discipline and accountability. This includes re-establishing OKRs throughout the organization to drive a common purpose.To help us execute toward our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are leveraging our Smart Capital approach. This approach is designed to enable us to adjust quickly to opportunities in the market, while managing our margin structure and capital spending. The key elements of Smart Capital include:▪Smart capacity investments. We are aggressively building out manufacturing shell space, which gives us flexibility in how and when we bring additional capacity online based on milestone triggers such as product readiness, market conditions, and customer commitments. ▪Government incentives. We are continuing to work with governments in the US and Europe to advance incentives for domestic manufacturing capacity for leading-edge semiconductors. ▪SCIP. We are accessing strategically aligned capital to increase our flexibility and help efficiently accelerate and scale manufacturing build-outs. This type of co-investment also demonstrates how private capital is unlocked and becomes a force multiplier for government incentives for semiconductor manufacturing expansion.▪Customer commitments. IFS is working closely with potential customers and exploring their willingness to make advance payments to secure capacity. This provides us with the advantage of committed volume, de-risking investments while providing capacity corridors for our foundry customers.▪External foundries. We intend to continue our use of external foundries where their unique capabilities support our leadership products. Fundamentals of Our Business9Table of ContentsOur CapitalWe deploy various forms of capital to execute our strategy in a way that seeks to reflect our corporate values, help our customers succeed, and create value for our stakeholders.

We strive to create an inclusive and positive work environment where every employee has a voice and a sense of belonging, and we are proactive in our efforts to reduce our environmental footprint through efficient and responsible use of natural resources and materials.We continue to raise the bar for ourselves and leverage our leadership position in the global technology ecosystem to make greater strides in corporate responsibility and apply technology to address social and environmental challenges. Through our RISE strategy, we aim to create a more responsible, inclusive, and sustainable world, enabled by our technology and the expertise and passion of our employees. In addition to our 2030 RISE goals established in 2020, in April 2022 we announced our commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across our global operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2040 and to increase the energy efficiency and lower the carbon footprint of our products and platforms. These are ambitious goals that strengthen our commitment to sustainable business practices under our RISE strategy. Our corporate responsibility strategy is designed to increase the scale of our work through collaboration with our stakeholders and other organizations; we know that we cannot achieve the broad social impact to which we aspire by acting alone. More information about our RISE goals, including progress we have made toward achieving them, is included in our Corporate Responsibility Report1.1  The contents of our Corporate Responsibility Report are referenced for general information only and are not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital10Table of ContentsFinancial CapitalWe take a disciplined approach to our financial capital allocation strategy, which continues to focus on building stockholder value and is driven by our priority to invest in the business and capacity and our capital needs. We also seek to pay competitive dividends and, from time-to-time, engage in mergers and acquisitions with a focus on adjacencies and complementary technology. As we invest in our IDM 2.0 strategy and implement our next phase of capacity expansions and the acceleration of our process technology roadmap, our allocation priorities have shifted more heavily toward investing in the business and away from stock repurchases. In the long term, we will continue to look for opportunities to further our strategy through acquisitions while remaining disciplined on capital allocation. Cash from Operating Activities $B■ Cash from Operating Activities■ Adjusted Free Cash Flow1Our Financial Capital Allocation StrategyInvest in the BusinessOur first allocation priority is to invest in R&D and capital spending to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the world's demand for semiconductors. We also respond to changing business and economic conditions. We adjusted and refocused our capital investment for 2022 and in the short term, while accelerating the deployment of our Smart Capital strategy. Return Excess Cash to StockholdersOur capital allocation strategy includes returning excess cash to stockholders. We achieve this through our dividend policy and when permissible, stock repurchases. We expect our future stock repurchases to continue to be significantly below our levels from 2021 and recent preceding years due to our current curtailment of this program.R&D and Capital Investments $BCash to Stockholders $B        ■ R&D■ Logic■ Memory2■ Repurchases■ DividendAcquire and IntegrateOur capital allocation strategy also includes opportunistic investment in and acquisition of companies that complement our strategic objectives. We look for acquisitions that supplement and strengthen our capital and R&D investments. Our key acquisitions over the last three years include the pending acquisition of Tower and our 2020 acquisition of Moovit to accelerate Mobileye’s MaaS offering.We take action when investments do not strategically align to our key priorities, and in 2022 we completed the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND memory business and began winding down our Intel Optane memory business. Additionally, in 2020 we completed the divestiture of the majority of our Home Gateway Platform, a division of CCG.1 See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&A.2 2021 and 2022 capital investments in Memory are not presented due to the divestiture of the NAND memory business announced in October 2020. 2018-2020 capital investments presented include Memory.  Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital11Table of ContentsIntellectual CapitalResearch and DevelopmentR&D investment is critical to enable us to deliver on our accelerated process technology roadmap, introduce leading products, and develop new businesses and capabilities in the future. We seek to protect our R&D efforts through our IP rights and may augment R&D initiatives by acquiring or investing in companies, entering into R&D agreements, and directly purchasing or licensing technology.Areas Key to Product LeadershipWe have intensified our focus on areas key to product leadership. Our objective with each new generation of products is to improve user experiences and value through advances in performance, power, cost, connectivity, security, form factor, and other features. We also focus on reducing our design complexity, re-using IP, and increasing ecosystem collaboration to improve our efficiency.Process and packaging. Our leading-edge process and packaging technology and world-class IP portfolio are key to the success of our strategy. This year, we have reaffirmed our commitment to achieving process technology leadership in 2025 by planning to deliver five technology nodes in four years. In addition, we have solidified our process and packaging offerings to external customers through IFS.▪We introduced further optimizations to our Intel 7 process node, which is now in production for our 13th Gen Intel Core processors (Raptor Lake).▪Intel 4, taking advantage of EUV, is a node that is designed to deliver significant density scaling and approximately 20% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 7. Meteor Lake is scheduled to be our first high-volume client product on Intel 4.▪We expect Intel 3 to deliver further logic scaling and up to 18% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 4. Intel 3 is our first advanced node offered to IFS customers and is optimized for the needs of Data Center products.▪Intel 20A will follow Intel 3 and will introduce two breakthrough technologies that we expect will deliver up to 15% performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 3: RibbonFET and PowerVia. RibbonFET, our implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, is designed to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins, but in a smaller footprint. PowerVia is our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery that is designed to optimize signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer.▪Intel 18A, our second IFS advanced node offering, improves on Intel 20A by delivering ribbon innovation for design optimization and line width reduction. Intel 18A is on schedule and expected to deliver an additional 10% improvement in performance per watt over Intel 20A.▪Beyond Intel 18A, we have already initiated definition and development of our next two process nodes and continue to define, build, and develop the next-generation High Numerical Aperture EUV lithography into our process technology roadmap.▪Our family of 3D advanced packaging technology will usher in the next generation of Foveros technology, enabling us to mix multiple top die tiles with multiple base tiles across mixed fab nodes, giving Intel and our customers greater flexibility for disaggregated chip designs. Our future Foveros Direct technology should scale interconnect pitch below 10µm, enable direct copper-to-copper bonding for low-resistance interconnects, and blur the boundary between wafer and package. xPU architecture. We believe the future is a diverse mix of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial architectures deployed in CPU, GPU, accelerator, and FPGA sockets, enabled by a scalable software stack and integrated into systems by advanced packaging technology. We are building processors that span several major computing architectures, moving toward an era of heterogeneous computing: ▪CPU. We started shipping our 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors (Sapphire Rapids) based on Intel 7 with the new Golden Cove core, built-in AI acceleration, cryptographic acceleration, and advanced security capabilities. We also launched our 13th Gen Intel Core processors (Raptor Lake), which will scale from thin and light laptops to enthusiast desktop and notebook platforms. These are based on a hybrid architecture utilizing Raptor Cove performance cores and Gracemont power-efficient cores and are socket-compatible with Alder Lake systems.▪GPU and HPC. Following the Q1 2022 launch of the first Intel® Arc™-branded laptop GPUs (A3 series), in Q4 2022 we launched the high-performance desktop GPUs (A7 series). Intel Arc GPUs offer dedicated graphics capability to power premium laptop and desktop experiences. Intel Arc A-Series GPUs come with advanced technologies to enable immersive gaming and powerful content creation in modern, portable designs. In Q4 2022, we also introduced the Intel® Max Series product family with two leading-edge products for high-performance computing and AI: Intel® Xeon® CPU Max Series (also known as Sapphire Rapids HBM) and Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series (also known as Ponte Vecchio). These new products will power the upcoming Aurora supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory and will help progress our vision of increasing the computing power of every human.▪Interconnect. Mount Evans, Intel’s first ASIC IPU, is designed to address the complexity of diverse and dispersed data centers. An IPU is designed to enable cloud and communication service providers to reduce overhead and free up performance for CPUs.▪Matrix Accelerator. In Q2 2022, we launched our second-generation deep learning processors for training and inference: Habana Gaudi2* and Habana Greco*. These new processors address an industry gap by providing customers with high-performance, high-efficiency, deep-learning compute choices for both training workloads and inference deployments in the data center, while lowering the AI barrier to entry for companies of all sizes. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital12Table of ContentsSoftware. Software unleashes the potential of our hardware platforms across all workloads, domains, and architectures. ▪In 2022, oneAPI adoption continued to expand across the industry. oneAPI enables developers to build cross-architecture applications using a single code base across CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs to reduce development time and enhance productivity. Our oneAPI-based tools take advantage of unique hardware features and lower software development and maintenance costs. Developers can choose the best architecture for the problem at hand without rewriting their entire code base, accelerating their time to value.▪We seek to accelerate adoption of oneAPI and Intel software developer tools through diverse ecosystem activities, including developer training, summits, centers of excellence, and access to Intel hardware and software through a developer cloud. The Intel® DevCloud, currently in public beta release, will host global users spanning AI, data science, high-performance computing, media and graphics, and other accelerated computing workloads.▪We believe AI will be ubiquitous, and with our tools and the broad open software ecosystem, we are well-positioned to scale AI. We optimize for the most widely used AI frameworks and libraries, including TensorFlow, Pytorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, XGBoost, and Spark, with certain optimizations delivering up to 100 times performance improvements to support end-to-end AI. We also develop innovative Intel software to accelerate developer productivity, such as OpenVINO™, Intel® Neural Compressor, BigDL, and AI software reference kits.  ▪We seek to continually improve our system and foundational-level software in support of our client, data center, networking, and graphics products, delivering AI-optimized software across the stack, including BIOS, firmware, simulation, operating systems, and virtualization.IP RightsWe own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. We have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are granted. As we expand our product offerings into new areas, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties. The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.Efforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see \"Risk Factors\" within Other Key Information. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital13Table of ContentsManufacturing CapitalAs the guardians of Moore's Law, we continuously innovate to advance the design and manufacturing of semiconductors to help address our customers' greatest challenges. This makes possible new leadership products with higher performance while balancing power efficiency, cost, and size. Our IDM 2.0 strategy allows us to deliver leadership products using internal and external capacity while leveraging our core strengths to provide foundry services to others. IDM 2.0 combines three capabilities. First, we will continue to build most of our products in Intel fabs. Second, we expect to expand our use of third-party foundry capacity to manufacture a range of modular tiles on advanced process technologies. Third, we are building a world-class foundry business with IFS, which we expect will combine leading-edge packaging and process technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other ecosystem IP. Network and Supply ChainIn 2022, our factories performed well in a highly dynamic environment, where we adapted to rapid demand shifts and industry component shortages affecting us and our customers. We continue to work across our supply chain to minimize disruptions, improve productivity, and increase overall capacity and output to meet customer expectations.Our global supply chain supports internal partners across architecture, product design, technology development, manufacturing and operations, sales and marketing, and business units, and our supply ecosystem comprises thousands of suppliers globally. Our mission is to enable product and process leadership, industry-leading total cost of ownership, and on-time and uninterrupted supply for our customers. We supplement our own manufacturing capacity through our use of third-party foundries. As of the end of 2022, we had nine manufacturing sites in production — five wafer fabrication facilities and four assembly and test facilities. The following map shows these factory sites and the countries where we have a significant R&D and/or sales presence. In our continued response to COVID-19, we maintained the operational measures put in place in 2020 and 2021 to enable a continued safe environment for our employees and the operation of our manufacturing sites. Our manufacturing facilities are primarily used for silicon wafer manufacturing, assembling, and testing of our platform products. We operate in a network of manufacturing facilities integrated as though they were one factory to provide the most flexible supply capacity, allowing us to better analyze our production costs and adapt to changes in capacity needs. Our new process technologies are transferred from a central development fab to each manufacturing facility. After transfer, the network of factories and the development fab collaborate to continue driving operational improvements. This enables fast ramp of the operation, quick learning, and quality control. We are expanding manufacturing capacity across multiple sites, including Arizona, Ireland, Israel, and Oregon as well as New Mexico and Malaysia for advanced packaging. This year, we broke ground on our new site in Ohio and officially added Germany to our roadmap.  Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital14Table of ContentsHuman CapitalOur human capital strategy is grounded in our belief that our people are fundamental to our success. Delivering on our strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent across the world. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace where the world’s best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet. We invest in our highly skilled workforce of 131,900 people by creating practices, programs, and benefits that support the evolving world of work and our employees’ needs. Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We are focused on reinvigorating our culture to strengthen our execution and accelerate our cadence of innovation. Our values—customer first, fearless innovation, results driven, one Intel, inclusion, quality, and integrity—inspire us and are key to delivering on our purpose. All employees are responsible for upholding these values, the Intel Code of Conduct, and Intel's Global Human Rights Principles, which form the foundation of our policies and practices and ethical business culture.Talent ManagementWe continue to see significant competition for talent throughout the semiconductor industry. Though we slowed the pace of hiring in the second half of 2022 in line with macroeconomic forecasts, financial performance, and cost-cutting measures, and took actions to rebalance our workforce, the investments we are making to accelerate our process technology require continued and focused efforts to attract and retain talent—especially technical talent. Our undesired turnover rate1 was 5.6% in both 2022 and 2021.We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Intel an employer of choice. We offer extensive training programs and provide rotational assignment opportunities and are working to update our job architecture to help employees create custom learning curricula for building skills and owning their careers. To further support the growth and development of our people, we continue to increase mentoring in our technical community, drive engagement through employee resource groups, and promote health and wellness resources to all our people. Through our annual Employee Experience Survey and Manager Development Feedback Survey, employees can voice their perceptions of the company, their managers, their work experience, and their learning and development opportunities. Our employees' voices are important to enable our culture of continuous improvement, and as a result, we link a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to participation in our Employee Experience Survey. Our performance management system is designed to support our cultural evolution and to increase our focus on disciplined OKRs. InclusionDiversity and inclusion are core elements of Intel's values and instrumental to driving innovation and positioning us for growth. Over the past decade, we have taken actions to integrate diversity and inclusion expectations into our culture, performance and management systems, leadership expectations, and annual bonus metrics. We are proud of what we have accomplished to advance diversity and inclusion, but we recognize we can achieve more, including beyond the walls of Intel. Our RISE strategy and 2030 goals set our global ambitions for the rest of the decade, including doubling the number of women in senior leadership; doubling the number of underrepresented minorities in US senior leadership; increasing the percentage of employees who self-identify as having a disability to 10%; and exceeding 40% representation of women in technical roles, including engineering positions and other roles with technical job requirements. To drive accountability, we continue to link a portion of our executive and employee compensation to diversity and inclusion metrics. We have committed our scale, expertise, and reach through our comprehensive RISE strategy to work with customers and other stakeholders to accelerate the adoption of inclusive business practices across industries. As part of the Alliance for Global Inclusion, we worked with a coalition of technology companies to create a Global Inclusion Index Survey, which serves as a benchmark for companies to track diversity and inclusion improvements, provide information on current best practices, and highlight opportunities to improve outcomes across industries. The results of the second Global Inclusion Index Survey were published in 2022 and shared with business leaders across industries. The number of companies that completed the inclusion index in 2022 nearly doubled compared to in 2021. This collective effort will allow the industry to more clearly identify actions needed to advance progress on closing persistent gaps and advancing more inclusive practices in workplaces, industry, and society. The survey results for 2022 showed participants making progress in many of these areas. We will also continue to collaborate on initiatives that expand the diverse pipeline of talent for our industry, advance social equity, make technology fully inclusive, and expand digital readiness for millions of people around the world. 1 Undesired turnover includes all regular Intel employees who voluntarily left Intel, but does not include Intel contract employees, interns, or employees who separated from Intel due to divestiture, retirement, voluntary separation packages, death, job elimination, or redeployment.2  Senior leadership refers to salary grades 10+ and equivalent grades. While we present male and female, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing of all gender identities.3 The term underrepresented minority (URM) is used to describe diverse populations, including Black/African American, Hispanic, and Native American employees in the US. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital15Table of ContentsCompensation and BenefitsWe structure pay, benefits, and services to meet the varying needs of our employees. Our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave, parent reintegration, fertility assistance, flexible work schedules, sabbaticals, and on-site services. Since 2019, we have achieved gender pay equity globally and we continue to maintain race/ethnicity pay equity in the US. We achieve pay equity by closing the gap in average pay between employees of different genders or race/ethnicity in the same or similar roles after accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences, such as location, time at grade level, and tenure. We have also advanced transparency in our pay and representation data by publicly releasing our EEO-1 survey pay data since 2019. We believe that our holistic approach toward pay equity, representation, and creating an inclusive culture enables us to cultivate a workplace that helps employees develop and progress in their careers at all levels. Our “hybrid-first” approach to working was informed by employees surveyed around the globe and involves the majority of our employees splitting their time between working remotely and in the office. Hybrid-first and remote work options cast a wider recruitment net and support our ambition to hire the best global talent. Currently, there is no company-wide mandate on the number of days per week employees should be on site or how they should collaborate. Our goal is to enable remote and on-site work where it drives the best output, while ensuring our employees have equitable access to systems, resources, and opportunities that allow them to succeed.Health, Safety, and WellnessOur commitment to Intel's Environmental, Health, and Safety Policy is to provide a safe and injury-free workplace. We regularly invest in programs designed to improve physical, mental, and social well-being. We provide access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs, including on-site health centers, and we aim to increase awareness of and support for mental and behavioral health. In support of our RISE goals, we will continue to build our strong safety culture and drive the global expansion of our corporate wellness program through employee education and engagement activities.Social and Relationship CapitalWe are committed to engaging in initiatives that support our communities and help us develop trusted relationships with our stakeholders. Proactive engagement with our stakeholders and investments in social impact initiatives, including those aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, advance our position as a leading corporate citizen and create shared value for Intel, our global supply chain, and our communities.Economic and social. The health of our business and local economies depends in part on continued investments in innovation. We provide high-skill, high-paying jobs around the world, many of which are manufacturing and R&D jobs located in our own domestic and international factories. As we expand operations in Arizona, Oregon, Ohio, and Europe, we are building a pipeline of qualified workers through our talent strategy and the many investments we are making in education. We also benefit economies through our R&D ecosystem spending, sourcing activities, employee spending, and tax payments. We make sizable capital investments and provide leadership in public-private partnerships to spur economic growth and innovation. We stand at the forefront of new technologies that are increasingly being used to empower individuals, companies, and governments around the world to solve global challenges. We aim to empower people through education and advance social initiatives to create career pathways into the technology industry. This includes our global Intel Digital Readiness Programs, such as AI for Youth and AI for Workforce, scaled in partnership with governments and institutions to empower individuals with digital readiness and AI skills. Additionally, we invest in multi-year partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities in the US to increase the number of Black/African Americans who pursue electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science fields. Our employees and retirees share their expertise through volunteer initiatives in the communities where we operate, volunteering approximately 2.81 million hours over the past three years. These efforts contribute to our RISE goal to volunteer 10 million hours over a decade. COVID-19 presented challenges over the last few years for in-person volunteering, but we continued to see an outpouring of support from employees for virtual volunteering, donations, and innovative technology projects to support our communities, and in 2022, a return to more in-person volunteering. Since 2020, we announced and further expanded upon the Intel RISE Technology Initiative, which provides an expanded channel to build deeper relationships with our customers and partners aligned with our corporate purpose and work to create shared value through our RISE strategy. Specifically, we are funding projects in areas such as using technology to improve health and safety, making technology more inclusive while expanding digital readiness, and carbon-neutral computing to help address climate change. Human rights commitment. We are committed to maintaining and improving processes to avoid complicity in human rights violations related to our operations, supply chain, and products. We have established an integrated approach to managing human rights across our business, including senior-level management involvement, with board-level oversight. We also meet throughout the year with external stakeholders and experts on human rights to continue to inform and evolve our human rights policies and oversight processes. While we do not always know, nor can we control, what products our customers create or the applications end users may develop, we do not tolerate our products being used to violate human rights. When we become aware of a concern that our products are being used by a business partner in connection with abuses of human rights, our policies require that we restrict or cease business with the third party until we have high confidence that our products are not being used to violate human rights. 1 This is a preliminary estimate. The final number will be reported in our 2022-23 Corporate Responsibility Report, to be issued later in 2023. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital16Table of ContentsSupply Chain ResponsibilityWe actively manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve overall performance and value creation for Intel, our customers, and our suppliers. To drive responsible and sustainable practices throughout our supply chain, we have robust programs to educate and engage suppliers that support our global manufacturing operations. We actively collaborate with other companies and lead industry initiatives on key issues such as improving transparency around climate and water impacts in the global electronics supply chain and, as part of our RISE strategy, we are advancing collaboration across our industry on responsible minerals sourcing. Through these efforts we help set electronics industry-wide standards, develop audit processes, and conduct training.Over the past decade, we have directly engaged with our suppliers to verify compliance and build capacity to address risks of forced and bonded labor and other human rights issues. We perform supplier audits and identify critical direct suppliers to engage through capability-building programs, which help suppliers build sustainability acumen and verify compliance with the Responsible Business Alliance and our Code of Conduct. We also engage with indirect suppliers through our programs on forced and bonded labor, responsible minerals, and supplier diversity. To achieve our RISE goals, we are significantly expanding the number of suppliers covered by our engagement activities. The supply chain environmental team is also actively engaging suppliers to measure and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions footprints, and the resulting impact on our footprint, in order to meet our long-term emissions reductions goals.Our commitment to diversity and inclusion also extends to our suppliers. We believe a diverse supply chain supports greater innovation and value for our business. We have set additional spending targets with women-owned suppliers outside the US and with minority-owned suppliers globally to accelerate progress toward our goal to increase global annual spending with diverse suppliers by 100% to reach $2 billion in annual spending by 2030. We continue to only retain or use outside law firms in the US that are above average on diversity for their equity partners and apply a similar rule to firms used by our tax department, including non-legal firms.Natural CapitalDriving to the lowest possible environmental footprint as we grow helps us create efficiencies, support our communities, and respond to the needs of our stakeholders. We invest in environmental projects and set company-wide environmental targets to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water use, and waste generation. We build energy efficiency into our products to help our customers lower their own emissions, energy usage and costs, and we collaborate with policymakers and other stakeholders to use technology to address environmental challenges. In April 2022, we announced our new goal to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in our operations by 2040, creating an important target to strengthen our commitment to sustainable business practices. Our 2030 RISE goals continue to be important milestones to drive to higher levels of operational efficiency, including a goal of a 10% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions on an absolute basis by 2030. We continue to take action on emissions reduction strategies focused on emissions abatement, additional investments in renewable electricity, process and equipment optimization, and energy conservation. Our RISE strategy also focuses on addressing climate change impacts upstream and downstream in the value chain. This includes improving product energy efficiency and increasing our \"handprint\"—the ways in which Intel technologies can help others reduce their footprints, including Internet of Things solutions that enable intelligence in machines, buildings, supply chains, and factories, and make electrical grids smarter, safer, and more efficient. In Q3 2022, we completed our inaugural green bond issuance of $1.3 billion principal amount of senior notes. We are using the proceeds from the green bond offering to fund projects that support our investments in sustainable operations, which can include items such as green buildings, energy efficiency, circular economy and waste management, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, water stewardship, and renewable energy. The first annual green bond impact report will be published in 2023 to provide an update on the allocation of the net proceeds.EnergyWe focus on reducing our own climate change impact, and over the past two decades have reduced our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy consumption. Through our RISE goals, we have committed to a goal of conserving 4 billion kWh of energy this decade. We have conserved approximately 973 million kWh1 of energy cumulatively since 2020. We also invest in renewable electricity and on-site alternative energy projects in support of our 2030 goal to achieve 100% renewable electricity use across our global operations. In 2022, continuing our practice of linking a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our corporate sustainability metrics, we linked a portion of the performance bonus to our 2022 target to reach 90% renewable electricity use globally. We reached our target and achieved approximately 91%1 renewable electricity usage globally in 2022.1  This is a preliminary estimate. The final number will be reported in our 2022-23 Corporate Responsibility Report, to be issued later in 2023. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital17Table of ContentsWater StewardshipWater is essential to the semiconductor manufacturing process. We use ultrapure water to remove impurities from our silicon wafers, and we use fresh and reclaimed water to run our manufacturing facility systems. Through our RISE goals, we have committed to achieve net positive water globally, and as part of that effort, conserve 60 billion gallons of water in this decade. Water conservation reduces the amount of water needed from fresh water sources; we have conserved approximately 26.2 billion gallons1 of water and enabled restoration of approximately 6.6 billion gallons1 of water since 2020. In 2022, we linked a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our targets to conserve 8.5 billion gallons of water and restore 2.5 billion gallons of water to local watersheds, both of which we achieved.Circular Economy and Waste ManagementWe have long been committed to waste management, recycling, and circular economy strategies that enable the recovery and productive re-use of waste streams. Our 2030 goals include a target of zero total waste2 to landfill, as well as implementation of circular economy strategies for 60% of our manufacturing waste streams in partnership with our suppliers. We continue to focus on opportunities to upcycle waste by improving waste segregation practices and collaborating with our suppliers to evaluate new technologies for waste recovery.Governance and DisclosureWe are committed to transparency around our carbon footprint and climate risk, and use the framework developed by the TCFD to inform our disclosure on climate governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. For governance and strategy, we follow an integrated approach to address climate change, with multiple teams responsible for managing climate-related activities, initiatives, and policies, with senior-level management involvement and board-level oversight, including the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. We describe our overall risk management processes in our Proxy Statement, and describe our climate-related risks and opportunities in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, the Intel Climate Change Policy, and \"Risk Factors\" within this Form 10-K. In addition to what is included within this Form 10-K, information about and progress toward our RISE goals is included in our Corporate Responsibility Report. Our Corporate Responsibility Report also includes a mapping of our disclosure to the TCFD and SASB frameworks. The Corporate Responsibility Report and our CDP Climate Change Survey are available on our website and are published annually.3 1  This is a preliminary estimate. The final number will be reported in our 2022-23 Corporate Responsibility Report, to be issued later in 2023.2 Intel defines zero waste as less than 1%.3  The contents of our website and our Corporate Responsibility Report, Climate Change Policy, and CDP Climate Change Survey are referenced for general information only and are not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital18Table of ContentsManagement's Discussion and AnalysisOur ProductsWe are a global IDM of CPUs and related solutions that we design, develop, manufacture, market, sell, support and service. Our CPUs and related solutions are incorporated in computing and related end products and services, and utilized globally by consumers, enterprises, governments, and educational organizations. Our customers primarily include OEMs, ODMs, cloud service providers, and other equipment manufacturers that we market and sell to directly through our global sales and marketing organizations and indirectly through channel partners. We manufacture our products at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities located throughout the world. Our CPU and related product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from edge computing to 5G networks, the cloud, and the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving. Products, such as our gaming CPUs, may be sold directly to end consumers, or they may be further integrated by our customers into end products such as notebooks and storage servers. Combining some of these products—for example, integrating FPGAs with Intel Xeon processors in a data center solution—enables incremental synergistic value and performance. We launched new products in 2022, such as the 12th Gen Intel Core HX processors, the final products in our Alder Lake family; Raptor Lake, our 13th Gen Intel 7 client product; and Sapphire Rapids, the first of our 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors. We also added to our graphics offerings with the introduction of Ponte Vecchio and Alchemist.Our diverse product line includes CPU and chipset, an SoC, or a multichip package based on Intel® architecture that processes data and controls other devices in a system. The primary CPU products in CCG are our Intel Core processors, which include designs specifically for notebook and desktop applications. The primary CPU product in DCAI is our Intel Xeon processor, which includes solutions for data center compute, networking, and the intelligent edge. The primary offerings of NEX include Intel Xeon, Intel Core, and Intel Atom® processor products. During 2022, we managed our business through the operating segments that are presented below and have included the 2022, 2021 and 2020 financial results for each segment. \"Note 3: Operating Segments” within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K reconciles our segment revenues presented below to our total revenues, and our segment operating margin (loss) presented below to our total operating margin (loss), for each of the periods presented. We have also included a discussion of our 2022, 2021 and 2020 consolidated results of operations and related information subsequent to the operating segment discussion below.MD&A19Overview% Intel RevenueWe are committed to advancing PC experiences by delivering an annual cadence of leadership products and deepening our relationships with industry partners to co-engineer and deliver leading platform innovation. We engage in an intentional effort focused on long-term operating system, system architecture, hardware, and application integration that enables industry-leading PC experiences. We will embrace these opportunities by simplifying and focusing our roadmap, ramping PC capabilities even more aggressively, and designing PC experiences even more deliberately. By doing this, we believe we will continue to fuel innovation across Intel, providing a growing source of IP, scale, and cash flow.Key Developments■Our revenue was $31.7 billion, down 23% in 2022, driven by macroeconomic weakness that negatively impacted PC TAM, particularly in the consumer, education and small/medium business markets. Operating margin was $6.3 billion, down 60% year over year primarily due to lower notebook and desktop revenue, higher unit costs, increased investments in leadership products, and higher inventory reserves.■COVID-related dynamics like work- and learn-from-home solidified the PC as an essential tool in the post-pandemic world. We launched our 12th Gen Intel Core H, S, U, and P-series processors and introduced our 13th Gen Intel Core processor family starting with our desktop processors, the second iteration of our performance hybrid architecture built on Intel 7 process technology.■We worked with industry partners to co-engineer and deliver more than 153 verified Intel® Evo™ designs and grew the commercial market segment with the launch of our Intel vPro® platform with the 12th Gen Intel Core processor and commercial offerings.MD&A20Table of ContentsMarket and Business OverviewMarket Trends and StrategyIn 2022, the PC business experienced one of the most challenging years in recent history, resulting from a softening macroeconomic environment and inflationary pressures. Despite these headwinds in 2022—which resulted in a double-digit TAM decline1—PC usage remains strong, demonstrating the increased utility and value of the PC and we believe ultimately supporting a TAM well above pre-pandemic levels, once this period of adjustment subsides. The significant behavior changes that took shape amid the pandemic solidified the PC as an essential tool in people's lives.   PC density, including PCs per household, increased during the pandemic, which irreversibly changed the way we focus, create, connect, and care for each other2. In addition, the installed base of PCs per student continues to grow compared to pre-pandemic levels. Commercial growth opportunities also remain as corporations expand the size of their PC fleets, while also replacing older devices. Currently, approximately 200 million commercial devices are more than four years old3. The experience and capabilities delivered on new PCs are dramatically better today, reinforcing the opportunity to drive a refresh cycle among enterprise customers.As we continue on our strategy to develop more competitive products and more capabilities for customers, we are designing our product roadmap to drive product leadership grounded in a philosophy of openness and choice. We deliver value to our customers by leveraging our engineering capabilities and working with our partners across an open, innovative ecosystem to deliver technology that drives every major vector of the computing experience, including performance, battery life, connectivity, graphics, and form factors to create the most advanced PC platforms. Products and CompetitionWe released our 13th Gen Intel Core desktop processors, the second generation of our performance hybrid architecture, which combines efficient-cores and performance-cores to deliver performance and experiences that are scalable across all PC market segments. The 13th Gen processor family is expected to deliver uncompromised computing performance for every PC segment and out to the edge. In total, we expect to deliver more than 500 designs from partners across major multinational corporations and leading manufacturers.We operate in a particularly competitive market. In processors, we compete with AMD and vendors who design applications processors based on ARM architecture, such as Qualcomm Inc. (Qualcomm), and, increasingly, Apple Inc. (Apple), with its M1 and M2 products. We expect this competitive environment to continue to intensify in 2023.Our role as a technology leader is more important than ever, and our commitment to creating an open ecosystem is critical to delivering on our ambition. This is why we embrace and collaborate with a vibrant ecosystem of OEM partners to identify innovation vectors and deliver leadership technologies together. The breadth of a robust ecosystem like Microsoft Windows/x86 is a powerful combination, bringing together hundreds of companies around the globe and creative and innovative advancements that are not possible for one company to deliver alone.Unique to Intel, we innovate beyond the CPU to deliver premium PC experiences with Intel Evo and Intel vPro platforms. More than 150 advanced laptop designs have been built on the Intel Evo platform, and we test and verify these to confirm they deliver key experience indicators such as responsiveness, battery life, instant wake, and connectivity. Intel vPro is designed for enterprise needs and delivers increased productivity improvements, connectivity, security features, and remote manageability.Through our efforts to increase internal and external capacity, supply availability for our products has improved, which enables us to service our customers in a more consistent and responsive manner.

The increasing heterogeneity of chips increases the complexity of designing chips with optimized PPAC that are manufacturable with high yield. Additionally, integrating these diverse chips into systems becomes more complex and requires optimized interconnects and a software stack that can easily accept this diversity of chips without compromising PPAC. This is causing a paradigm shift from focusing on optimizing devices to focusing on optimizing the system, known as system technology co-optimization. In this new paradigm, customers require solutions that address every layer of the application stack, rather than just the chip itself.  Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic and recent geo-political issues have highlighted the world’s dependence on semiconductors and the vulnerable supply chain that underpins the industry. Approximately 88% of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is in Asia, and only 4.5% is in the US1. Products and CompetitionWe seek to address this tectonic shift in the industry by creating an open system foundry that enables our customers to lead in their industries by creating full-stack solutions from their choice of the best of Intel and the ecosystem.

The open system foundry involves engaging with customers at multiple levels, from basic wafer manufacturing to helping define and implement their desired system architecture. We intend to build our customers' silicon design and deliver full end-to-end capabilities to produce their products, built with our advanced packaging technology and delivered from a resilient, geo-diverse and sustainable source of supply.  The foundation of our IFS strategy is a world-class foundry offering consisting of process technologies complemented by a robust ecosystem for IP, EDA, and design services. Chips created with IFS can be packaged using our advanced packaging technologies or by OSATs and connected by optimized interconnects that we will help drive as standard for the industry, such as, UCIe. We expect to accelerate our customers' designs by providing services and software that leverage our vast experience in designing systems of chips, and by providing cores from Intel and the ecosystem that are optimized for Intel process technologies. The combination of cores and accelerators can be seamlessly integrated into systems using oneAPI. These offerings will accelerate customer time to value with PPAC-optimized systems delivered from a reliable supply chain. Our competitors are mostly pure-play foundries that focus on delivering a pure-play foundry offering from fabrication plants based in Asia. Of the five major semiconductor foundries, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), Samsung, Global Foundries (GF), United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, only Samsung is an IDM and foundry, and only GF is headquartered in the US. TSMC and Samsung are the only companies with advanced technologies below 10nm, and TSMC leads the market with 53% market share, followed by Samsung at 18% in 20212. Neither Samsung nor TSMC currently offer its most advanced nodes outside of Asia and both have limited advanced-node capacity in the US. We believe the open system foundry model will deliver differentiated capabilities to help our customers lead in their industries while bringing stability to the global semiconductor supply chain. The interest we are seeing from customers demonstrates that our strategy and offerings are resonating, and we look to continue to build on this in 2023 and in prospective periods.1Source: 2022 Gartner Worldwide Foundry Capacity Forecast by Region, 2020-2026.2Source: TrendForce.MD&A37Table of ContentsFinancial PerformanceIFS Revenue $BIFS Operating Income (Loss) $BRevenue and Operating Income (Loss) Summary2022 vs. 2021Revenue was $895 million, up $109 million from 2021, primarily driven by higher sales of MBMW tools.

We expect the macroeconomic uncertainty and the challenging market environment will extend into 2023.2022 vs. 20212022 revenue was $63.1 billion, down $16.0 billion, or 20%, from 2021. CCG revenue was down 23% from 2021 due to lower notebook and desktop volume in the consumer and education market segments, and lower revenue due to the continued ramp down from the exit of our 5G smartphone modem business and lower demand for our wireless and connectivity products. Notebook volume decreased, driven by lower demand in the consumer and education market segments, while ASPs increased due to the resulting product mix. Desktop volume decreased, driven by lower demand in the consumer and education market segments while ASPs increased due to an increased mix of commercial products. DCAI revenue decreased 15% from 2021 due to lower server demand from enterprise customers, and due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories in a softening data center market. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from our FPGA business. Server ASPs decreased due to customer and product mix. NEX revenue increased 11% from 2021, driven by higher Ethernet ASPs and increased demand for 5G products, partially offset by lower demand for Network Xeon. Mobileye revenue increased 35% from 2021, primarily driven by higher demand for EyeQ products and Mobileye Supervision* systems. The decrease in our \"all other\" revenue was due to revenue from the divested NAND memory business of $4.3 billion recognized in 2021, for which historical results are recorded in “all other,” and $584 million of revenue recognized in 2021 from a prepaid customer supply agreement.Incentives offered to certain customers to accelerate purchases and to strategically position our products with customers for market segment share purposes, particularly in CCG, contributed approximately $1.7 billion to our revenue during Q4 2022, the impacts of which were contemplated in our financial guidance for Q1 2023, as included in our Form 8-K dated January 26, 2023. We expect CCG demand in Q1 2023 to be impacted as customers work through additional inventory.2021 vs. 20202021 revenue was $79.0 billion, up $1.2 billion, or 1%, from 2020. NEX revenue increased 12% from 2020, primarily driven by higher demand for edge products amid recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19 as well as a recovery in cloud networking revenue, partially offset by a reduction in the 5G networking volume from elevated levels in 2020. CCG revenue was up 1% from 2020, due to higher notebook and desktop volume driven by consumer and commercial recovery from COVID-19 lows, partially offset by lower revenue due to the continued ramp down from the exit of our 5G smartphone modem business. Notebook ASPs decreased due to the resulting product mix from higher demand in the consumer and education market segments, while desktop ASPs increased driven by commercial recovery from COVID-19. Mobileye revenue increased 43% from 2020, driven by improvement in global vehicle production, recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19, and increasing adoption of ADAS. DCAI revenue decreased 3% from 2020 due to lower server revenue, partially offset by increased revenue from other DCAI products. Server volume decreased due to an increasingly competitive environment, partially offset by recovery in government and broader market products.MD&A40Table of ContentsGross MarginWe derived most of our overall gross margin in 2022 from the sale of products in the CCG and DCAI operating segments. Our overall gross margin dollars in 2022 decreased by $16.9 billion, or 39%, compared to 2021, and in 2021 increased by $203 million, or approximately flat, compared to 2020.

As of December 31, 2022, our capital investments classified as construction in progress totaled $36.7 billion. These assets are ready for use but have not yet been placed into service and have not yet begun depreciating. As these construction in progress assets are placed into service, we expect to incur depreciation expense that impacts future production costs and, ultimately, cost of sales. To the extent we are unable to grow our revenues to offset these production costs, our gross margin and operating income will be unfavorably affected. Additionally, we could incur asset impairments on property, plant and equipment assets if our IDM 2.0 strategy is not successful.Effective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 years to 8 years. We made this change to better reflect the economic value of our machinery and equipment over time. We considered several factors in making this determination, including current usage and expected re-use of machinery and equipment, changes in machinery and equipment technology, future planned cadence between node transitions, a shift to longer duration on trailing-edge technologies, and overall changes in our technology roadmap. Our analysis supported a change in useful life and is consistent with the execution of our IDM 2.0 strategy. This change in estimate will be applied prospectively beginning Q1 2023. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, we expect total depreciation expense in 2023 to be reduced by as much as $4.2 billion. We expect this change will result in an approximately $2.6 billion increase to gross margin, a $400 million decrease in R&D expenses, and a $1.2 billion decrease in ending inventory values.Operating ExpensesTotal R&D and MG&A expenses for 2022 were $24.5 billion, up 13% compared to 2021. These expenses represent 38.9% of revenue for 2022 and 27.5% of revenue for 2021. In support of our strategy, we continue to make significant investments to accelerate our process technology roadmap. This requires increased investments in R&D and continued focused efforts to attract and retain talent. In the second half of 2022, we implemented certain cost-cutting measures, including a slower pace of hiring and other restructuring actions, while at the same time continued to improve our product execution in response to the continued decline in the broader macroeconomic environment.

We expect these actions to be substantially completed by the end of 2023, but this is subject to change. Litigation charges and other includes a $1.2 billion benefit in 2022 from the annulled penalty related to an EC fine that was recorded and paid in 2009, and a charge of $2.2 billion in 2021 related to the VLSI litigation.

In 2021, we recognized $471 million in observable price adjustments related to our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd.In 2022, the sale of McAfee Corp. (McAfee) consumer business was completed and we received $4.6 billion in cash for the sale of our remaining share of McAfee, recognizing a $4.6 billion gain in Sale of equity investments and other. In 2021, we recognized McAfee dividends of $1.3 billion, which included a special dividend of $1.1 billion paid in connection with the sale of McAfee's enterprise business, and recognized $228 million related to the partial sale of our investment in McAfee. We recognized McAfee dividends of $126 million in 2020.In 2022, we also recognized $278 million of initial fair value adjustments in Sale of equity investments and other related to five companies that went public; in 2021, we recognized $447 million of initial fair value adjustments related to four companies that went public; in 2020, we recognized $1.1 billion from Montage becoming marketable and $606 million related to four other equity investments that went public.

In 2022 we recognized a benefit from taxes as compared to a provision for taxes in 2021 as the higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US jurisdictions and the change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform were only partially offset by the tax costs associated with the gains recognized from the equity sale of McAfee and the divestiture of our NAND memory business.Our effective tax rate decreased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by one-time tax benefits due to the restructuring of certain non-US subsidiaries as well as a higher proportion of our income in non-US jurisdictions. As a result of the restructuring, we established deferred tax assets and released the valuation allowances of certain foreign deferred tax assets. The majority of these deferred tax assets established in 2021 fully offset the deferred tax liabilities recognized in 2020 driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to undistributed earnings in China, as a result of our divestiture of our NAND memory business.MD&A44Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesWe believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, supplemented by our total cash and investments1, is our primary source of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; and potential and pending acquisitions, strategic investments, and dividends. This includes a commitment of $5.4 billion associated with our pending acquisition of Tower. See “Note 10: Acquisitions and Divestitures” within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology. These plans include an investment to build two new fabs in Arizona and capacity expansions in Ohio and Europe and involve utilizing SCIP and smart capacity investments, both elements of our Smart Capital strategy. We also expect to benefit from government incentives; any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our investments. Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements. We expect our planned capital investments to continue to put pressure on our adjusted free cash flow in the short term.As we invest in multiple expansions, we expect our capital expenditures to continue to be higher than historical levels for the next several years. We expect to adjust the cadence of our investments based on the execution of our roadmap and changing business conditions. As of December 31, 2022, we had commitments for capital expenditures of $22.7 billion for 2023 and had $8.3 billion in capital expenditures committed in the long term. As of December 31, 2022, other purchase obligations and commitments in 2022 under our binding commitments for purchases of goods and services were $3.1 billion, with an additional $7.6 billion committed in the long term.Additionally, as we have faced industry shortages of substrates and other components, we have increasingly entered into long-term agreements with suppliers and foundry service providers, some of which involve prepayments that will help us secure future supply. These prepayments accelerate cash outflows into the near term, and we expect to apply the prepayments to future purchases, resulting in a positive impact on our liquidity in subsequent periods. We have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures and other purchase obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. For example, see \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our lease obligations, which include supply agreements structured as leases, \"Note 8: Income Taxes\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our tax obligations including impacts from Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings, and \"Note 13: Borrowings\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our debt obligations. The expected timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition, some of our purchasing requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included in the amounts above. For example, some of these requirements are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by vendors on a purchase order basis within short time horizons.When assessing our current sources of liquidity, we include our total cash and investments1 as shown in the following table: (In Millions)Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Cash and cash equivalents$11,144 $4,827 Short-term investments17,194 24,426 Loans receivable and other463 240 Total cash and investments1$28,801 $29,493 Total debt$42,051 $38,101 1  See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&AWe maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in investment-grade securities. MD&A45Table of ContentsOther potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, other securities, and non-recourse factoring arrangements with third-party financial institutions. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion and, as of December 31, 2022, we had $3.9 billion of commercial paper obligations outstanding. During 2022, we issued a total of $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, including our inaugural green bond issuance of $1.3 billion principal amount. We are using the proceeds from the green bond offering to fund projects that support our investments in sustainable operations. We intend to use the proceeds from the remainder of the offering for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing our outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures. We received proceeds of $600 million in the aggregate from the sale of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona (CIDA). We amended our $5.0 billion variable-rate revolving credit facility, extending that maturity date by one year to March 2027 and transitioning the interest terms from LIBOR to term SOFR. In November 2022, we entered into a $5.0 billion, 364-day variable rate revolving credit facility. We repaid $1.6 billion of our senior notes that matured in May 2022; $1.0 billion due July 2022; $1.9 billion due December 2022; and $400 million due November 2023. We settled $138 million bonds issued by the Oregon Business Development Commission in March 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facilities.Our sources of liquidity in 2022 also included total net proceeds of $1.0 billion from the completion of Mobileye's IPO in the fourth quarter of 2022, after which we retained 94% of Mobileye’s capital stock.Our cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. In the second half of 2022 these actions included, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. While such actions have benefited, and may further benefit, cash flow in the near term, we may experience a corresponding detriment to cash flow in future periods as these actions cease or as the impact of these actions reverse or normalize. Our cash flows for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Net cash provided by operating activities$15,433 $29,456 $35,864 Net cash used for investing activities(10,477)(24,449)(21,524)Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities1,361 (6,045)(12,669)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$6,317 $(1,038)$1,671 Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.For 2022 compared to 2021, the $14.0 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower 2022 net income after adjusting for non-cash items, including the gain on the sale of McAfee and the pre-tax gain from the divestiture of our NAND business; partially offset by 2022 cash-favorable working capital changes compared to 2021.For 2021 compared to 2020, the $6.4 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a decrease in net working capital contributions and cash paid to settle a prepaid customer supply agreement in Q1 2021, partially offset by a McAfee special dividend received in Q3 2021.Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; cash used for acquisitions; and proceeds from divestitures. Our capital expenditures were $24.8 billion in 2022 ($18.7 billion in 2021 and $14.3 billion in 2020). The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to increased maturities and sales of short-term investments, proceeds from the divestiture of our NAND business, and proceeds from the sale of our remaining share of McAfee, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by lower 2021 purchases of short-term investments, net of maturities and sales.Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.MD&A46Table of ContentsCash provided by financing activities in 2022 compared to cash used for financing activities in 2021 primarily due to higher commercial paper and debt issuances, our 2022 curtailment of common stock repurchases, proceeds from the Mobileye IPO, and partner contributions for joint investments; partially offset by higher 2022 debt repayments. Our total dividend payments were $6.0 billion in 2022 compared to $5.6 billion in 2021. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 121 quarters. The decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of common stock and a decrease in repayments of debt and debt conversions, partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by long-term debt issuances.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the judgment was made, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our Consolidated Financial Statements. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was made.Refer to \"Note 2: Accounting Policies\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates, which are as follows, as well as our significant accounting policies:▪Inventories—the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory, net of factory excess capacity costs. Inventory reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering forecasted future demand and market conditions; ▪Long-lived assets—the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment and evaluation of useful lives of property, plant and equipment, identified intangibles, and impairment of goodwill, including the determination of asset groupings and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units;▪Non-marketable equity investments—the valuation estimates and assessment of impairment and observable price adjustments; and▪Loss contingencies—the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.Starting in the first quarter of 2022, we incrementally exclude from our non-GAAP results share-based compensation and all gains and losses on equity investments. The adjustment for all gains and losses on equity investments includes the ongoing mark-to-market adjustments previously excluded from our non-GAAP results.Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects where applicable. Income tax effects have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate for each adjustment, as applicable. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.Non-GAAP adjustment or measureDefinition Usefulness to management and investorsNAND memory businessWe completed the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND memory business to SK hynix on December 29, 2021 and fully deconsolidated our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022.We exclude the impact of our NAND memory business in certain non-GAAP measures. While the second closing of the sale is still pending and subject to closing conditions, we deconsolidated this business in Q1 2022 and management does not view the historical results of the business as a part of our core operations. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core business model and how management currently evaluates core operational performance. In making these adjustments, we have not made any changes to our methods for measuring and calculating revenue or other financial statement amounts.MD&A47Table of ContentsNon-GAAP adjustment or measureDefinition Usefulness to management and investorsAcquisition-related adjustmentsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years.We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.Share-based compensationShare-based compensation consists of charges related to our employee equity incentive plans.We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these adjustments provide better comparability to peer company results and because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our core operating performance. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core business model, how management currently evaluates core operational performance, and additional means to evaluate expense trends, including in comparison to other peer companies.Patent settlementA portion of the charge from our IP settlements represents a catch-up of cumulative amortization that would have been incurred for the right to use the related patents in prior periods. This charge related to prior periods is excluded from our non-GAAP results; amortization related to the right to use the patents in the current and ongoing periods is included.  We exclude the catch-up charge related to prior periods for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because this adjustment facilitates comparison to past operating results and provides a useful evaluation of our current operating performance.Optane inventory impairmentBeginning in 2022, we initiated the wind-down of our Intel Optane memory business.We exclude these impairments for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges do not reflect our current operating performance. This adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.Restructuring and other chargesRestructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges include a benefit in Q1 2022 related to the annulled EC fine, a charge in Q1 2021 related to the VLSI litigation, periodic goodwill and asset impairments, certain pension charges, and costs associated with restructuring activity.We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our core operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.(Gains) losses on equity investments, net(Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists of ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable equity securities, observable price adjustments on non-marketable equity securities, related impairment charges, and the sale of equity investments and other.We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because it provides better comparability between periods. The exclusion reflects how management evaluates the core operations of the business.Gains (losses) from divestitureGains (losses) are recognized at the close of a divestiture, or over a specified deferral period when deferred consideration is received at the time of closing. Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement entered into in connection with the first closing of the sale of our NAND memory business on December 29, 2021, a portion of the initial closing consideration was deferred and will be recognized between first and second closing.We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because they do not reflect our current operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.MD&A48Table of ContentsNon-GAAP adjustment or measureDefinition Usefulness to management and investorsTax Reform Adjustments for Tax Reform reflect the impact of a change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform related to the capitalization of R&D costs.We exclude the impacts of this 2022 change in US tax treatment of R&D costs for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures as we believe these adjustments facilitate a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to past operating results.Adjusted free cash flowWe reference a non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted free cash flow, which is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow adjusted for (1) additions to property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from capital grants and partner contributions, (2) payments on finance leases, and (3) proceeds from the McAfee equity sale.This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in understanding our capital requirements and sources of liquidity by providing an additional means to evaluate the cash flow trends of our business. Since the 2017 divestiture, McAfee equity distributions and sales have contributed to operating and free cash flow, and while the McAfee equity sale in Q1 2022 would typically be excluded from adjusted free cash flow as an equity sale, we believe including the sale proceeds in adjusted free cash flow facilitate a better, more consistent comparison to past presentations of liquidity.Total cash and investmentsTotal cash and investments is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity, which include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and loans receivable and other.This non-GAAP measure is helpful in understanding our capital resources and liquidity position.Following are the reconciliations of our most comparable US GAAP measures to our non-GAAP measures presented:Years Ended (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Net revenue$63,054 $79,024 $77,867 NAND memory business— (4,306)(4,967)Non-GAAP net revenue$63,054 $74,718 $72,900 Gross margin percentage42.6 %55.4 %56.0 %Acquisition-related adjustments2.1 %1.6 %1.6 %Share-based compensation1.0 %0.4 %0.4 %Patent settlement0.3 %— %— %Optane inventory impairment1.1 %— %— %NAND memory business— %0.6 %1.8 %Non-GAAP gross margin percentage47.3 %58.1 %59.8 %Earnings per share—diluted1$1.94 $4.86 $4.94 Acquisition-related adjustments0.37 0.36 0.33 Share-based compensation0.76 0.50 0.44 Patent settlement0.05 — — Optane inventory impairment0.18 — — Restructuring and other charges— 0.64 0.05 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net(1.04)(0.67)(0.45)(Gains) losses from divestiture(0.28)— — NAND memory business— (0.33)(0.22)Tax Reform(0.20)— — Income tax effects0.06 (0.06)(0.03)Non-GAAP earnings per share—diluted$1.84 $5.30 $5.06 1 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the impact of non-controlling interest to our non-GAAP adjustments is insignificant and thus is not included in our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.MD&A49Table of ContentsYears Ended (In Millions)Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Dec 29, 2018Net cash provided by operating activities$15,433 $29,456 $35,864 $32,618 $29,757 Net additions to property, plant, and equipment(23,724)(18,567)(14,086)(15,948)(14,649)Payments on finance leases(345)— — — — Sale of equity investment4,561 — — — — Adjusted free cash flow$(4,075)$10,889 $21,778 $16,670 $15,108 Net cash used for investing activities$(10,477)$(24,449)$(21,524)$(13,579)$(11,638)Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities$1,361 $(6,045)$(12,669)$(17,864)$(18,533)MD&A50Table of ContentsOther Key InformationSales and MarketingCustomersWe sell our products primarily to OEMs, ODMs, and cloud service providers. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase Intel processors and other products from our distributors. Certain of our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets.Sales ArrangementsOur products are sold through distribution channels throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. Because our customers generally order from us on a purchase order basis, they can typically cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using electronic and web-based processes that allow customers to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.In accordance with contract terms, the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, usually 30 days after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors can exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. DistributionDistributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.Seasonal TrendsHistorically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. In 2021, continued strong COVID-driven notebook demand in the first half of the year contributed to a flatter trend than we historically observe. In 2022, we had a flatter trend than we historically observe as we experienced the uncertainty and impacts, including demand volatility and supply chain disruption, of current macroeconomic conditions, the potential for a recession, and the risk for continued COVID-related disruptions or shutdowns.MarketingOur global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, differentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives preference with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Atom, Celeron®, Pentium®, Intel® Movidius™, and Intel Xeon trademarks make up our key CPU brands. This year, we introduced the Intel® Max Series product family with two leading-edge products for high-performance computing (AI): the Intel Xeon CPU Max Series (also known as Sapphire Rapids HBM) and Intel Data Center GPU Max Series (also known as Ponte Vecchio).MD&A51Table of ContentsWe promote brand awareness and preference and generate demand through our own direct marketing, as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press relations. We market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for our products. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as connectivity.Certain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs. These cooperative advertising and marketing programs broaden the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Certain customers are licensed to place Intel® logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to customers meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not eliminate, the impacts of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange RatesWe are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-US-dollar-denominated investments in debt and equity instruments and loans receivable, and may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-US-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in US dollars. However, a significant portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies, primarily the Israeli shekel, the Malaysian ringgit, the European Union euro, the Japanese yen, and the Chinese yuan. We have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-US dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-US dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards or option contracts in these hedging programs. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 10% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, would result in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $64 million and less than $38 million, respectively.Interest RatesWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and provide financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally track the SOFR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into SOFR-based returns. We also entered into swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into floating-rate coupon payments for a portion of our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.A hypothetical change in benchmark interest rates of 1%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our investment portfolio of less than $100 million as of December 31, 2022 and as of December 25, 2021.Taking into account floating-rate debt and fixed-rate debt that is swapped to floating-rate debt, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 1% would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $120 million from debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022 (a hypothetical increase of 1% would have resulted in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $132 million from debt outstanding as of December 25, 2021). Equity PricesWe are exposed to equity market risk through our investments in marketable equity securities, which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activities. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of our marketable equity securities was $1.3 billion ($2.2 billion as of December 25, 2021). The substantial majority of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of December 31, 2022 was concentrated in securities traded on the Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity securities, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio. Assuming a decline of 50% in market prices, the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by approximately $670 million, based on the value as of December 31, 2022 (a decrease in value of approximately $1.3 billion, based on the value as of December 25, 2021 using an assumed decline of 60%). Other Key Information52Table of ContentsWe utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities.Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as IPOs, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 ($4.1 billion as of December 25, 2021) and include our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. of $1.1 billion ($1.1 billion as of December 25, 2021). Commodity Price RiskAlthough we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities. Risk FactorsThe following summarizes the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. When any one or more of the following risks materialize from time to time, our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations can be materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations can also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including in the MD&A and Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.Changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results. Demand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our products varies within or among them. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, we expect the PC TAM to grow over time driven by factors such as a larger installed base, new platforms, shorter replacement cycles, and adoption in new markets; however, the PC industry has been highly cyclical in the past, and these growth expectations may not materialize, or we may fail to capitalize on them. Changes in the demand for our products, particularly our CCG, DCAI, and NEX platform products, have reduced and can in the future reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.Important factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:▪business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;▪consumer confidence, income levels, and customer capital spending, which can be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing or spending, taxation, interest rates, the credit market, current or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;▪geopolitical conditions, including trade policies;▪our ability to timely introduce competitive products; ▪competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;▪the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;▪customer order patterns and order cancellations, including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products, customers' products, and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles; and disruptions affecting customers, such as the delays in obtaining tools, components, and other supplies as a result of COVID-19-related port shutdowns in China that negatively impacted demand for our business in 2022, as well as the industry substrate and component shortages that negatively impacted demand across several of our businesses in 2021;▪market acceptance and industry support of our products and services, including the introduction and availability of software and other products used together with our products, as well as our foundry services offerings through IFS; and▪customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user computing workloads, such as work-, hybrid-, and learn-from-home trends.Other Key Information53Table of ContentsDue to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we are not always able to timely respond to fluctuations in demand and we may incur significant charges and costs. Because we own and operate high-tech fabrication facilities, our operations have high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to utilization of existing facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce in response to lower revenues. We could also be required to write off inventory or record excess manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. As we continue to make substantial investments in increasing our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, these underutilization risks may be heightened. Conversely, at times, demand increases or we fail to forecast accurately or produce the mix of products demanded. To the extent we are unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough, we are at times required to make production decisions and/or are unable to fully meet market demand, which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships. Our IDM 2.0 investments in capacity and our process technology roadmap require capital expenditures above our historical levels, and if demand for our IFS business grows rapidly, we anticipate that we would need to accelerate our planned investments to meet that demand. To the extent we do not generate expected cash flows, we may be required to increase our use of external funding sources to fund our investments and operations, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Legislation in the US and EU has been adopted to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions, but there is uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of funding we may receive and as to any restrictions on recipients. To the extent such funding is below our expectations, our anticipated cash requirements would increase. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm.We face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological, geopolitical and market developments; changes in industry standards; changes in customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent product introductions and improvements. When we do not anticipate or respond to these developments, our competitive position can weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has intensified, and we expect it to continue to do so in the future.Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by product and market segment. For example, our competitors have introduced data center and client platform products with performance improvements and additional processor core counts that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment. In our IOTG business within NEX, for example, interoperability, connectivity, safety, security, industrial use conditions, and long-life support are among the key competitive factors. To the extent our products do not meet our customers' requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape, our business and results of operation can be harmed.We face intense competition across our product portfolio from companies offering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; accelerator products such as GPUs, including those offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity and networking products; and other semiconductor products. Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms, such as the ARM architecture, and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. For example, ARM-based products are being used in PCs and servers, which could lead to further development and growth of the ARM ecosystem. We also compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers. Some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads. For example, in 2020, Apple introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in place of our client CPUs, and we face increasing competition from Apple's products and ecosystem.Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as TSMC or Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and subcontractors for manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products. Manufacturing process improvements introduced by TSMC have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to increasingly competitive offerings by our competitors. While we have set out a process technology roadmap to attain future process performance-per-watt parity and leadership relative to TSMC, our plans are subject to a number of risks and we could fail to realize our goals, including due to changes in competitor technology roadmaps, changes affecting our projections regarding our technology or competing technology, and the risks described in the section \"We are vulnerable to product and manufacturing-related risks.\" As an IDM, we have higher capital expenditures and R&D spending than many of our \"fabless\" competitors. We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or business collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which could have a significant impact on our competitive position. For example, we could face increased competition as a result of China's programs to promote a domestic semiconductor industry and supply chains.Other Key Information54Table of ContentsIntroduction of competitive new products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products, exert downward pricing pressure on our products, and adversely affect our business. For example, our DCAI revenue and platform ASPs were negatively impacted by the competitive environment during 2022 and 2021. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. For example, in 2022, Broadcom announced an agreement to acquire VMware, and AMD completed its acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.If we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.We invest significantly in R&D, and to the extent our R&D efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position can be harmed, and we may not realize a return on our investments. To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, and improve our existing products and processes, all ahead of competitors. Our R&D efforts intensely utilize our different forms of capital, and we incurred R&D expenses of $17.5 billion in 2022, $15.2 billion in 2021and $13.6 billion in 2020. We are focusing our R&D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. We cannot guarantee that all of these efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. To the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, and/or transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we can face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages. In addition, periods of extended investment in R&D and operational strategy can impact our financial condition and planning and may result in periods of higher leverage, operating costs, borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of our Sapphire Rapids product would be delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utilization of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.We do not expect all of our R&D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products and technologies fail or fall short of our expectations, or are not well-received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant investments in R&D, and our investments are growing as we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy. Our investments at times do not contribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Our investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. We have entered new areas and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by ubiquitous computing, cloud to edge infrastructure, pervasive connectivity, and AI. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU products, and silicon photonics. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we announced plans to establish IFS as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others and to implement an internal foundry operating model through updates to our processes, systems, and guardrails between our manufacturing and our individual business units. IFS faces competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC and Samsung, and to succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; manufacturing capacity; price; margin; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Our \"big bets\" are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2022, we wound down Intel Optane; in 2020, we agreed to sell our NAND memory business to SK hynix; and in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business--three of our prior big bets--based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for those businesses. These new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices, margins, or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.Other Key Information55Table of ContentsChanges in the mix of products sold can materially impact our financial results. Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our platform product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based on Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon processors. Our adjacent products also typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced platform products, and at times are not profitable. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platform products in any of our market segments, or our adjacent products represent a greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross margin percentage has decreased and may decrease again.We are vulnerable to product and manufacturing-related risks.We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing technologies. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the development of next-generation process technologies at increasingly advanced nodes as we seek to realize the benefits of Moore's Law. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials or new production equipment, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes, and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially understood. We are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology, and in 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) that resulted in delays relative to our prior expectations. In 2022, Sapphire Rapids was also delayed to build in more platform and product validation time. These delays have allowed competitors using third-party foundries such as TSMC to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us by these competing foundries, including improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which have helped increase the competitiveness of their products. Because of these prior delays in our process technologies, we may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products. Our efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process and packaging technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance of the technology introduction. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost, performance, power, and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&D investments, particularly as development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses.Risks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, failure to achieve expected performance, power, and area improvements, and product defects and errata. Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs and adversely affect our gross margins, and can contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. A new process node typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields, and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes. As the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields.From time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors; defects in materials; delays in obtaining or revising permits and licenses; interruptions in our supply of materials, resources, or production equipment; adverse changes in equipment productivity; and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations. In addition, delays in our product introductions can cause us to become less competitive and lose revenue opportunities, and our gross margin could be adversely affected because we incur significant costs up front in a product's lifecycle stage and earn revenue to offset these costs over time.We face supply chain risks. We have a highly complex global supply chain composed of thousands of suppliers. These suppliers provide direct materials for our production processes; supply tools, equipment, and IP (via licenses) for our factories; deliver logistics and packaging services; and supply software, lab and office equipment, and other goods and services used in our business. We also rely on suppliers to provide certain components for our products and to manufacture and assemble and test some of our components and products. From time to time, we are negatively impacted by supply chain issues, including:▪suppliers extending lead times, experiencing capacity constraints, limiting or canceling supply, allocating supply to other customers including competitors, delaying or canceling deliveries, or increasing prices;▪supplier quality issues;▪cybersecurity events, IP or other litigation, manmade or natural disasters, operational failures, or other events that disrupt suppliers;▪long lead times to qualify alternate or additional suppliers, or the unavailability of qualified alternate suppliers; andOther Key Information56Table of Contents▪increased legislation, regulation, or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices, such as heightened reporting and other obligations with regard to environmental impacts, the risk of forced labor, or supplier conduct that does not meet such standards, which can result in supply chain disruptions, the loss of a supplier, and the government seizure of goods, as well as cause our compliance costs to increase or result in publicity that negatively affects our reputation.These and other supply chain issues can increase our costs, disrupt or reduce our production, delay our product shipments, prevent us from meeting customer demand, and damage our customer relationships. They may keep us from successfully implementing our business strategy and can materially harm our business, competitive position, results of operation, and financial condition. From time to time, our customers experience disruptions or shortages in their own supply chains that constrain their demand for our products. During 2022, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, as well as outbreaks of COVID-19 in certain regions of the world, caused supply chain disruptions and delays in obtaining tools and other components, while in 2021, the semiconductor industry experienced widespread shortages of substrates and other components and available foundry manufacturing capacity. These shortages have previously limited our ability to supply customer demand in certain of our businesses, such as for our FPGA products, and have adversely affected customer demand for our products, including in our CCG and DCAI businesses, as some customers have been unable to procure sufficient quantities of third-party components used together with our products to produce finished systems. It is difficult to predict the future impact of these shortages when they occur.To obtain future supply of certain materials and components, particularly substrates, and third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, we have entered into arrangements with some of our suppliers that involve long-term purchase commitments and/or large prepayments. These arrangements may not be adequate to meet our requirements, or our suppliers may fail to deliver committed volumes on time or at all, or their financial condition may deteriorate. If future customer demand over the horizon of such arrangements falls below our expectations, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, unneeded capacity, and increased costs, and our prepayments may not be fully utilized, and in some cases may not be fully recoverable. We utilize third-party foundries and component suppliers to manufacture or supply certain components and products for areas such as networking, communications, graphics, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we expect to increase our use of third-party foundries for manufacturing, which will include modular tiles manufactured on advanced foundry process technologies for use in our core computing offerings. Delays in the development of foundries’ future manufacturing processes could delay the introduction of products or components we design for such processes, and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent us from meeting customer demand. We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, manufacturing yields, quality, product quantities, and costs for components and products that are manufactured by third parties. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply. However, for certain components, services, materials, and equipment, we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. For example, ASML is currently the sole supplier of EUV photolithography tools that we will be deploying in our Intel 4 and other future manufacturing process nodes. These tools are highly complex to develop and produce, and increasingly costly, and from time to time there are increases in lead times or delays in their development and availability, which could delay the development or ramp of our future process nodes. As a further example, a limited number of third-party foundries offer leading-edge manufacturing processes, and these providers are geographically concentrated in Asia. Supplier consolidation or business failures can also reduce the pool of qualified suppliers. Sole- or limited-source suppliers can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us and intensify the other risks described in this risk factor.Our disaggregated design strategy introduces additional production risks. Our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase.We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues. From time to time, we identify product defects, errata (deviations from published specifications), and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or gain through acquisitions, can also contain defects. Product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third-party products and software. We face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or applications, including transportation, autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses. Costs from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:▪writing off some or all of the value of inventory;▪recalling products that have been shipped;▪providing product replacements or modifications;▪providing consideration to customers, including reimbursement for certain costs they incur;▪defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; andOther Key Information57Table of Contents▪paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and/or result in delay or loss of revenue. Mitigation techniques designed to address product issues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis—or at all—and do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues for all applications. We and third parties, such as hardware and software vendors, make prioritization decisions about which product issues to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation and result in costs. Product defects, errata, or other product issues and/or mitigation techniques can result in product failures, adverse performance and power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and other issues. Product issues can damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases or deployment, result in legal liability, or make our products less competitive, which could harm our business and financial results. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a product issue. In addition, our liability insurance coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products. We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products, as well as the operating systems and workloads that run on them and the components that interact with them. Components and IP we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard specifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. Our processors and other products are being used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category known as side-channel vulnerabilities, such as the variants referred to as \"Spectre\" and \"Meltdown.\" Additional categories and variants have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified. Publicity about these and other security vulnerabilities has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Security and manageability features in our products cannot make our products absolutely secure, and these features themselves are subject to vulnerabilities and attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become known. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a security vulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become aware of additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products, and address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.Mitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, are not always available on a timely basis—or at all—and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness, and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether, when, and how to develop and deploy mitigations. Export restrictions may impede our ability to provide updates or patches to customers in certain geographies or that appear on sanctions lists, potentially leaving systems unpatched and open to exploitation. Further, sanctions lists may include third parties with whom we need to interact for coordinated vulnerability disclosure, which may impair our ability to receive information about vulnerabilities and to deliver mitigations for them. We and such third parties make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation. Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties.Security vulnerabilities and any limitations or adverse effects of mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For example, whether or not vulnerabilities involve attempted or successful exploits, they may result in our incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, providing product replacements or modifications, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. These effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are available, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation. Other Key Information58Table of ContentsWe are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, and safety and product regulations. The design, manufacturing, assembly and test of our products require the use and purchase of materials and chemicals that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our operations and those of our suppliers are further governed by regulations prohibiting the use of forced labor (e.g., mining conflict minerals), and restrictions on other materials, as well as laws or regulations governing the operation of our facilities, sale and distribution of our products, and use of our real property. The scope and interpretation of such laws and regulations, including the materials they govern, are complex and continue to evolve. The procedures and processes in place under our compliance program may become onerous or increasingly expensive to maintain and cannot guarantee compliance by employees or third parties to whom such laws apply. The amendment or expansion of these laws or regulations, as well as our failure or inability to comply with them (including as a result of acquired entities) can result in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; increased costs; additional remediation obligations; suspension of production; alteration, suspension, or termination of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes, including due to an inability to find, afford, or attain adequate substitute materials, equipment, or processes; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. In addition, the failure or inability to comply by our suppliers of these materials can require us to suspend or alter our production processes and sources, and result in increased risks and costs.The failure or inability by us or our customers and suppliers to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements, may impede our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future. Environmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, cease the use of a particular material or process, remove or remediate hazardous substances, or incur other expenses or liabilities. Regulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements. For example, semiconductor manufacturing uses perfluorocarbons, which have historically made up a large portion of our direct greenhouse gas emissions. New or increased regulations limiting the use of such compounds, or other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to install additional abatement equipment, purchase carbon offsets, and/or alter, where feasible, our production processes and sources. In addition, new or increased climate change regulation could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities. As we expand our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, the impacts of future regulation could be magnified. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations are subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.We have established and report on our initiatives, aspirations, and goals related to corporate responsibility matters, which exposes us to numerous risks. A wide range of stakeholders, including governments, customers, employees, and investors, are increasingly focused on and developing expectations regarding corporate responsibility matters such as sustainability, human capital management, data privacy and cyber security, and human rights. This attention has resulted in a variety of required and voluntary reporting regimes that are not harmonized and continue to change. For example, governments around the world have enacted or are contemplating legislation and regulation that may impact how we conduct and/or report on our business by requiring the disclosure and tracking of certain greenhouse emissions and other climate and biodiversity information, and/or cyber security or human capital matters related to our business. Third-party groups and non-profit organizations, among others, have also established standards for rating, or frameworks for reporting, on corporate responsibility initiatives. In response to the evolving stakeholder expectations and new or proposed standards, customers and investors have formalized and expanded their own corporate responsibility goals and expectations that may influence how they assess, invest in, or utilize other businesses. If we fail to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives that meet our stakeholders' expectations, that could negatively impact us. Our corporate responsibility initiatives, including our 2030 RISE strategy and related goals, could also expose us to heightened scrutiny and numerous financial, legal, reputational, operational, compliance and other risks, including lost customer opportunities, that could negatively impact us. Our achievement of initiatives, aspirations, and goals related to corporate responsibility matters, including those related to sustainability, is not guaranteed and is subject to numerous conditions, risks, and expectations; standards, processes, and methodologies that are early in their advancement and continue to evolve; and science for which development is ongoing. Our RISE strategy and related goals, and expectations about costs to achieve those goals, are based on current iterations of varied process and reporting frameworks, as well as management's current expectations regarding the availability, efficiency, development, and cost of particular technologies, consumer trends, and other assumptions, and changes in those items could negatively impact our ability to achieve those goals, or the cost of achieving them. From time to time, we may change, expand, or reduce the standards to which we report or goals that we seek to meet. Our failure or inability to achieve such goals—or the perception by stakeholders of such failure or inability—may negatively affect our reputation or results of operations. Even if achieved, these matters may not result in some or all of the benefits anticipated at the time they were established.The COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has previously adversely affected significant portions of our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Authorities in jurisdictions where we operate, or in which our suppliers, customers, or others operate, have imposed, and businesses and individuals have implemented, varied measures to try to manage or contain the virus or treat its impact, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place/stay-at-home and social distancing orders, shutdowns, and vaccine requirements. These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations and demands of our customers, and those of our respective suppliers and partners. We have experienced, and could in the future experience, reduced workforce availability at some of our sites, construction delays, and reduced capacity at some of our suppliers. We have significant manufacturing operations in the US, Ireland, Israel, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and some of these countries Other Key Information59Table of Contentscontinue to take measures in response to the pandemic. Restrictions on our manufacturing or support operations or workforce, similar limitations for our suppliers, and transportation restrictions or disruptions can limit our ability to meet customer demand and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our customers have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions in their operations and supply chains, which can result in delayed, reduced, or cancelled orders, or collection risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations. The pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices, including with respect to flexible work and social distancing measures. These and other measures introduce additional operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, and have affected the way we conduct our product development, validation, and qualification; customer support; and other activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. The pandemic has also previously resulted in substantial economic uncertainty and volatility and disrupted historical patterns related to demand for our products and services that may impact our ability to accurately predict future demand, trends, or other matters that may impact our financial performance. The degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, and there is no certainty that measures we have taken or will take will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus. Additional impacts and risks may arise that we or our customers, suppliers, and other partners are not aware of or able to respond to effectively, and which may adversely affect us. The impact of COVID-19 can also exacerbate other risks discussed in these risk factors and throughout this report.We operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions.Global or regional conditions can harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the US accounted for 74% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, with revenue from billings to China contributing 27% of our total revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to execute our business strategy, manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control.Adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth; changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy; higher interest rates; tighter credit; inflation; lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure; increases in unemployment; and lower consumer confidence and spending. Adverse changes in economic conditions can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital and credit markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments. We can be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur, including:▪geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and terrorist activity, including, for example, geopolitical tensions and conflict affecting Israel, where our Mobileye business headquarters and certain of our fabrication facilities are located;▪natural disasters, public health issues (including pandemics), and other catastrophic events;▪inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions, materials shortages or delays, and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;▪formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and changes in the ability to obtain export licenses, which could be changed without notice;▪government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from or distribute compensation or other funds in a particular country;▪adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives, including more favorable incentives provided to competitors;▪differing employment practices and labor issues, including restricted access to talent;▪ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;▪local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;▪continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the US and abroad; and▪fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, and in the capital and credit markets, which can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, interest rate changes, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors.For example, in 2022, in response to Russia’s war with Ukraine, numerous countries and organizations have imposed financial and other sanctions and export controls against Russia and Belarus, while businesses, including Intel, have limited or suspended Russian operations. Russia has likewise imposed currency restrictions and regulations and may further take retaliatory trade or other actions, including the nationalization of foreign businesses. These and other actions have exposed the company to the risks described herein and to additional uncertainty and risks regarding increases to supply, commodity, and other costs, damage to our reputation, and cyberattacks; and may increase the likelihood, or amplify the impacts, of other risks, including those highlighted in these risk factors and throughout this report.Other Key Information60Table of ContentsWe are also subject to risks related to the cessation of US dollar LIBOR. Certain of our derivatives and floating-rate investments reference US dollar LIBOR, and a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on US dollar LIBOR. No new US dollar LIBOR-based activity can be conducted after 2021, and US dollar LIBOR will be unavailable for use in our existing contracts and financial instruments beyond June 30, 2023. While reasonable alternatives to LIBOR have been introduced into markets, our transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates could result in an increase in our interest expense and/or a reduction in our interest income.We are subject to risks related to trade policies and regulations. Trade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets. In particular, trade tensions between the US and China have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to some of our products, and have affected customer ordering patterns. The US has imposed restrictions on the export of US-regulated products and technology to certain Chinese technology companies, including certain of our customers. These restrictions have reduced our sales and continuing or future restrictions could adversely affect our financial performance, result in reputational harm to us, or lead such companies to develop or adopt technologies that compete with our products. It is difficult to predict what further trade-related actions governments may take, which may include trade restrictions and additional or increased tariffs and export controls imposed on short notice, and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to or mitigate such actions. Trade disputes and protectionist measures, or continued uncertainty about such matters, could result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us. Sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, and decoupling of global trade networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.Laws and regulations can have a negative impact on our business. We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy and localization requirements; competition; advertising; employment and labor; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. For example, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G or autonomous driving technology and MaaS may limit global adoption, impede our strategy, or negatively impact our long-term expectations for our investments in these areas. Expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data-protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and services, particularly in cloud, Internet of Things, and AI applications, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads.Our policies, controls, and procedures designed to help provide for compliance with applicable laws cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.We are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in US dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the US where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates can harm our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in our effective tax rate may impact our net income. A number of factors can impact our effective tax rate, which could reduce or increase our net income, including:    •changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;•changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;•adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;•increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;•changes in available tax credits;•changes in our ability to secure new, or renew existing, tax holidays and incentives;•changes in US federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the US to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-US income and expenses, and changes resulting from the adoption by countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development recommendations or other legislative actions;Other Key Information61Table of Contents▪changes in accounting standards; and▪our decision to repatriate non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.Catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations and business, and those of our customers and suppliers, can be disrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health issues; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, telecommunications, or IT systems providers; manufacturing equipment failures; or other catastrophic events. For example, we have at times experienced disruptions in our manufacturing processes as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, and disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, including due to cybersecurity incidents affecting our suppliers. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change can result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities, including our facilities located in water-sensitive regions such as Arizona and Israel. In addition, to the extent we are unable to successfully manage and conserve water resources, our reputation could be harmed. In recent years, the west coast of the US has experienced significant wildfires, including in Oregon, where we have major manufacturing facilities, and in California, where we are headquartered. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the technology industry in particular are unclear but could be severe. Catastrophic events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from such disruptions. Furthermore, even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly, if our customers or suppliers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, we may experience reduced or cancelled orders or disruptions to our supply chain that may adversely affect our results of operations.We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.Damage to our reputation can damage our business. Our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers, employees, governments, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Our failure to address, or the appearance of our failure to address, issues that give rise to reputational risk, including those described throughout these risk factors, could significantly harm our reputation and our brands. Our reputation can be impacted by catastrophic events; incidents involving unethical behavior or misconduct; product quality, security, or safety issues; allegations of legal noncompliance; internal control failures; corporate responsibility and governance issues; data breaches; workplace safety incidents; environmental incidents; our response to climate change, including our greenhouse gas emission levels; the use of our products for illegal or objectionable applications, including AI and machine learning applications that present ethical, regulatory, or other issues; marketing practices; media statements; the conduct of our suppliers or representatives; and other issues, incidents, or statements that, whether actual or perceived, result in adverse publicity. To the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address corporate crises, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brands and could lead to increases in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions. Damage to our reputation could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business and operating environment. It could reduce investor confidence in us, adversely affecting our stock price. It may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employees. Moreover, repairing our reputation and brands may be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive.We are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks.We face risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet, or to introduce malicious software, to our IT systems. Individuals or organizations, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored organizations, insider threats including employees and third-party service providers, or intruders into our physical facilities, at times attempt to gain unauthorized access and/or corrupt the processes used to design and manufacture our hardware products and our associated software and services. Due to the widespread use of our products, we are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, compromise, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our suppliers, customers, partners, or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, suppliers, and customers; interrupt our systems and services or those of our suppliers, customers, or others; or demand ransom to return control of such systems and services. Such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication, and if successful, expose us and the affected parties to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations, including our manufacturing operations. Our IT infrastructure also includes products and services provided by third parties, and these providers can experience breaches of their systems and products, or provide inadequate updates or support, which can impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or confidential information. In addition, we are a global company with operations and employees around the world. We face risks related to the use or misuse, inadvertent or otherwise, of our IT systems by employees, vendors, and other individuals with access to our systems.Other Key Information62Table of ContentsFrom time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure, as well as those of third parties who provide products and services to us. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, our Habana Labs subsidiary’s network was breached, resulting in unauthorized third-party access of certain confidential information, in connection with a suspected unsuccessful ransomware attack. The breach was confined to our subsidiary's network and has not had a material impact on Habana Labs’ business. We are also subject to risks associated with attacks involving our supply chain, such as the compromise of IT infrastructure management software provided by SolarWinds Corporation, reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. During 2021, we have observed an increase in ransomware attacks in our supply chain. In December 2021, a vulnerability named “Log4Shell” was reported for the widely used Java logging library, Apache Log4j 2. We reviewed the use of this library within our software product portfolio and in our IT environment, but the steps we have taken to mitigate the vulnerability may not be sufficient to mitigate all related risks. To date, cybersecurity incidents have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations, but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, writing down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain the business relationship, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties, as well as reputational harm. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work and remote access to our systems has increased significantly, which also increases our cybersecurity attack surface. We have also seen an increase in cyberattack volume, frequency, and sophistication driven by the global enablement of remote workforces. We seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes or updates to our internal processes and tools and changes or updates to our products and services; however, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. In some instances, we, our suppliers, our customers, and the users of our products and services can be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. There is increasing regulation regarding responses to cybersecurity incidents, including reporting to regulators, which could subject us to additional liability and reputational harm.Theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business, including data stored with vendors or other third parties, could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. We anticipate that our collection of such personal data will increase as we enter into the MaaS market in our Mobileye business, and it may increase as we enter into other new or adjacent businesses. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data-protection measures could be significant, and noncompliance could expose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and even criminal sanctions. Even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data-protection laws and regulations could result in audits, regulatory inquiries, or proceedings against us by governmental entities or other third parties.We are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We cannot always protect our IP or enforce our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP and IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. We are not always able to obtain protection for our IP or enforce or protect our IP rights. Enforcement is costly and time-consuming and can divert management attention. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. From time to time, governments adopt regulations—and governments or courts render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and business. In some cases, our IP rights can offer inadequate protection for our innovations. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced. This risk is heightened as competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees.Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to some of our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.Other Key Information63Table of ContentsThird parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business. We face claims based on IP rights from individuals, companies, non-practicing entities, academic and research institutions, and other parties, including claims from those who have aggregated patents acquired from multiple sources to form a new, larger portfolio to assert claims against us and other companies. Additionally, large patent portfolio owners sometimes divest portions of their portfolios to more than one individual or company, increasing the number of parties who own IP rights that were previously all held by a single party. We have seen an increase in patent assertions and lawsuits initiated by well-funded non-practicing entities, including entities funded by investment firms and other third parties. In some instances, these entities have filed multi-jurisdiction litigation seeking large monetary damages and/or injunctions against us. These lawsuits can increase our cost of doing business, impact our reputation or relationship with customers, and could disrupt our operations if they succeed in blocking the trade of our products. For example, in the multi-jurisdiction litigation brought against us by VLSI, juries in certain of the US federal court cases returned unfavorable verdicts against us of $945 million in damages in November 2022 and approximately $2.2 billion in damages in February 2021, both of which we expect to appeal or have appealed as discussed in \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The patent litigation environment has also become more challenging due to the emergence of venues adopting procedural and substantive rules that make them more favorable for patent asserters, including the availability of injunctive relief for non-practicing entities, and the US Patent and Trademark Office’s reduction of inter partes patent review under the America Invents Act. As a result, we believe we are facing a more hostile IP litigation environment.We are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products, technologies, or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets, confidential information, or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers' businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.As a result of IP rights claims, we could:▪pay monetary damages, payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, royalties, fines, or penalties;▪stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;    ▪need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or▪enter into settlement or license agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and may be costly.These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of our products are designed to include third-party technology or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. In addition, from time to time, third parties notify us that they believe we are using their IP. There is no assurance that necessary licenses to such third-party IP can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that our existing licenses to third-party IP will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party technology, or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. To the extent our products include software that contains or is derived from open-source software, we may be required to make the software's source code publicly available and/or license the software under open-source licensing terms.We are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory matters. From time to time, we face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, commercial, IP, labor and employment, compliance, and other issues on a global basis. As described in \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur, including monetary damages, fines, penalties, or injunctions stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, harmful to our reputation, and distracting to management.Other Key Information64Table of ContentsWe must attract, retain, and motivate key employees. We believe that hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business. The competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense. Competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees, and the increased availability of flexible, hybrid, or work-from-home arrangements has both intensified and expanded competition. In addition, changes in immigration policies may further limit the pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. From time to time, we have intensified our efforts to recruit and retain talent, such as during 2021 and the first half of 2022, and these efforts have increased our expenses. Further, we may not be successful in attracting, retaining, and motivating the workforce necessary to deliver on our strategy, and we have been required to curtail our planned hiring or reduce our workforce to respond to business conditions that differ from our expectations, which can be disruptive, compromise our ability to deliver on our strategy and workforce goals, and impact our ability to recruit in the future. Changes in employment-related laws applicable to our workforce practices may also result in increased expenses and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. Sustained declines in our stock price, or lower stock price performance relative to competitors have been reducing the retention value of our share-based awards, which can impact the competitiveness of our compensation. Our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. To the extent our compensation programs and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive, or changes in our workforce and related restructuring, reduction-in-force or other initiatives are not viewed favorably, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees can be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. In addition, significant or prolonged turnover may negatively impact our operations and culture, as well as our ability to successfully maintain our processes and procedures, including due to the loss of historical, technical, and other expertise.Changes in our management team can also disrupt our business. For example, we appointed a new CFO in January 2022 and made several other changes to our senior leadership during the past year. The failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employees could adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent we do not effectively hire, onboard, retain, and motivate key employees, our business can be harmed.We are subject to risks associated with our strategic transactions.Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and adversely impact our results of operations. Strategic transactions are an important component of our financial capital allocation strategy. We routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions, including novel transactions such as our 2022 joint investment with Brookfield in the manufacturing expansion of our Ocotillo campus, and the divestiture of our NAND memory business. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:▪our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;▪failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and failure of its anticipated benefits to materialize;▪disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management's attention;▪failure of partners to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely;▪our inability to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding a project, property, or entity;▪failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, if at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals at all or without materially burdensome conditions, mandated acquisitions, divestitures, or disposals, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or other unforeseen factors;▪our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, and restructuring charges;▪our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses;▪our inability to retain key personnel of acquired or majority-owned businesses or our difficulty in integrating employees, business systems, and technology or otherwise operating the acquired business;▪controls, processes, and procedures of acquired or majority-owned businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to identify compliance issues or liabilities;▪our inability to resolve impasses or disputes with partners, including as a result of differences in our interests or goals;▪our failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets, majority-owned businesses or novel transactions; and▪the potential for our transactions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt.Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition, divestiture or partial divestiture or several concurrent strategic transactions. Moreover, our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we at times need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions or otherwise investing our resources in a manner that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives. Where an existing investment does not strategically align to our key priorities, we routinely evaluate opportunities for possible divestitures and other options. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of divestitures due to risks that include unfavorable prices and terms; Other Key Information65Table of Contentschanges in market conditions or geopolitical conditions affecting the regions or industries in which we or counterparties operate; changes in applicable laws; failure to receive regulatory or governmental approvals; limitations or restrictions due to regulatory or governmental approvals, litigation, contractual terms, or other conditions; delays in closing; lack of support by third parties; actions by competitors; adverse effects on our business relationships, operating results, or business due to the announcement and pendency of such transactions; and continued financial obligations, unanticipated liabilities, or transition costs associated with such transactions. In some cases, we are not able to divest investments on acceptable terms or at all.We invest in public and private companies and do not always realize a return on our investments. We make investments in public and private companies to further our strategic and financial objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return in a timely fashion, if at all. Our ability to realize a return on our investment in a private company, if any, is typically dependent on the company participating in a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, which at times includes bankruptcy, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment.We face risks related to our debt obligations.Our debt obligations could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including our ability to implement our strategy. We currently have $39.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. In addition, we have a commercial paper program of up to $10.0 billion and credit facilities to backstop these programs and otherwise provide access to committed capital of up to $10.0 billion. From time to time, we may incur additional indebtedness, refinance our existing debt, and issue additional notes or other debt securities in the future at a variety of interest rates, maturities, and terms. The semiconductor industry is a cyclical business and our revenue, cash flows, and outlook often fluctuate in accordance with this cycle, as well as prevailing macroeconomic conditions, our business strategy, and other risks described in these risk factors. These fluctuations, together with our debt level and related debt service obligations, could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing the risk of a future downgrade in our credit ratings that can potentially impact the value of our outstanding debt and increase our borrowing costs. We may also be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, debt refinancing, future acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, which will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Consequently, we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could adversely impact our ability to service to repay, outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and the cost of borrowing. We are subject to sales-related risks. We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties, such as distributors, value-added resellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs and ODMs. We depend on many distributors to help us create end-customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. At times, we rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products is limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products is not always easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties sell products that compete with our products, and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. From time to time, they face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.From time to time, our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized \"gray market.\" Our policies and procedures designed to keep our products away from the gray market may not be successful in achieving this objective. Gray market products can distort demand and pricing dynamics in our distribution channel and certain geographies, which at times adversely affects our revenue opportunities. Gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more challenging. Gray market products also sometimes include parts that have been altered or damaged, and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to be substandard. We receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Collectively, our three largest customers accounted for 42% of our net revenue in 2022, 43% of our net revenue in 2021 and 39% of our net revenue in 2020. We expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future.Other Key Information66Table of ContentsIndustry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increased the significance and purchasing power of certain customers, particularly cloud service providers, in some of our data center-focused businesses. The cloud and cloud applications represent a new and increasingly demanding computing environment. The further consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and applications; product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product security and security features. Our competitive position can be eroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors. We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, including serving cloud service provider customers, and the competitive environment adversely affected our results in DCAI in 2022. Some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including designs customized for their specific computing workloads. In addition, cloud services can be marketed to end users based on service levels or features rather than hardware specifications, or they can abstract hardware under layers of software, which can make it more difficult to differentiate our products to customers and end users. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely affected, and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise and government market segment customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud customer specifications, order changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs. The loss of key customers, a substantial reduction in sales to them, or changes in the timing of their orders can lead to a reduction in our revenue, increase the volatility of our results, and harm our results of operations and financial condition. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from domestic and foreign, local, regional, and national governments associated with grants, incentives, and sales of our products and services. Government demand and payment are often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including, with respect to US government contracts, congressional approval of appropriations. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, certain agreements with the US government are subject to special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, security, customers, and/or employees, and failure or inability to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or debarment from future business with the US government.We have fluctuations in our stock price and the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases. Our stock price can experience periods of significant volatility. For example, in 2022, our stock price ranged from a closing high of $55.91 to a closing low of $25.04. Changes in stock price or volume can also occur for the semiconductor industry more broadly, and may occur without regard to underlying company performance. Changes in our stock price can be driven by a variety of factors within or outside of our control, including the risks described above in these risk factors, as well as: fluctuations in national and global markets; fluctuations in our operating results and projections; announcements by us or our competitors; sentiment, speculation, valuation, analyses, or recommendations of stock analysts, social media, and the press; our credit rating; changes in holders of our stock; significant litigation or regulatory actions; and other periodic events.We are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program. The amount, timing, and execution of any share repurchases fluctuate based on factors that include prioritizing cash for other purposes, such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments, and any regulatory restrictions. Our stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. We expect our future stock repurchases to be significantly below our levels from the last few years. For example, in 2022, we did not repurchase any shares under our authorized stock repurchase program.PropertiesAs of December 31, 2022, our major facilities consisted of:(Square Feet in Millions)UnitedStatesOtherCountriesTotalOwned facilities34 25 59 Leased facilities1 5 6 Total facilities35 30 65 Our principal executive offices are located in the US.

In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 26, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Auditor's Reports73Table of ContentsInventory ValuationDescription of the MatterThe Company's net inventory totaled $13.2 billion as of December 31, 2022, representing 7.3% of total assets. As explained in \"Note 2: Accounting Policies\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company computes inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and applies judgment in determining saleability of products and the valuation of inventories. The Company assesses inventory at each reporting date in order to assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the products have achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers; the determination of normal capacity levels in its manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory; whether the product is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of saleable quality. Auditing management's assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the determination of lower of cost or net realizable value and excess and obsolete inventory reserves is judgmental and considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as customer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand. Additionally, for certain new product launches there is limited historical data with which to evaluate forecasts.How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over the costing of inventory, the determination of whether inventory is of saleable quality, the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value reserves including related estimated costs and selling prices, and the determination of demand forecasts and related application against on hand inventory.Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions (e.g., estimated product costs and selling prices, and product demand forecasts) and the underlying data used in management's inventory valuation assessment. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends. We assessed whether there were any potential sources of contrary information, including historical forecast accuracy or history of significant revisions to previously recorded inventory valuation adjustments, and performed sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in inventory valuation that would result from changes in the assumptions. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP      We have served as the Company's auditor since 1968.San Jose, CaliforniaJanuary 26, 2023 Auditor's Reports74Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel CorporationOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited Intel Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intel Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and our report dated January 26, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP                          San Jose, CaliforniaJanuary 26, 2023Auditor's Reports75Table of ContentsConsolidated Statements of

StatementsNote 1 : Basis of PresentationWe have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal year 2022 was a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were 52-week fiscal years. Fiscal 2023 is a 52-week fiscal year. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Intel and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, which include entities consolidated under the variable interest model. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation.In the first quarter of 2022, we reclassified the presentation of cash paid and received under our credit support annex agreements with derivative counterparties within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These reclassifications better reflect the economic intent of the credit support annex agreements, and result in changes to amounts previously reported for net cash provided by (used for) operating, investing, and financing activities.In the first quarter of 2022, we reclassified the presentation of certain marketable debt investments within our Consolidated Balance Sheets, combining all marketable debt investments with original contractual maturities of three months or more into short-term investments as they represent the investment of cash available for current operations. These reclassifications simplify our Consolidated Balance Sheets and result in changes to amounts previously reported as short-term investments, trading assets, and other long-term investments.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates.Note 2 : Accounting PoliciesRevenue RecognitionWe recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or services to customers. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sales. Our products often include a software component, such as firmware, that is highly interdependent and interrelated with the product and is substantially accounted for as a combined performance obligation. In accordance with contract terms, the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms. We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Variable consideration is estimated and reflected as an adjustment to the transaction price. We determine variable consideration, which consists primarily of various sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. Sales rebates earned by customers are offset against their receivable balances. Rebates earned by customers when they do not have outstanding receivable balances are recorded within other accrued liabilities.We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs for marketing activities for some of our products. We generally record the payment as a reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned, unless the payment is for a distinct service, which we record as an expense when the marketing activities occur. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements81Table of ContentsInventoriesWe compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities and associated costs change in nature from R&D to cost of sales, and when cost of sales can be capitalized as inventory. For a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as PRQ. We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. A single PRQ has previously valued inventory up to $870 million in the quarter the PRQ milestone was achieved. Prior to PRQ, costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost of sales in the period incurred.The valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities. We apply our historical loadings compared to our total available capacity in a statistical model to determine our normal capacity level. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges were $423 million in 2022 and insignificant in the comparative periods presented. Charges in years prior to those presented have ranged up to $1.1 billion taken in a particular fiscal year, such as in connection with the 2009 economic recession.Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle, variations in market pricing, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. Lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserves fluctuate as we ramp new process technologies, with costs generally improving over time due to scale and improved yields. Additionally, inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical changes in market conditions and the associated pricing environment.The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We use a demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we write off amounts considered to be excess inventory. Long-Lived AssetsProperty, Plant and EquipmentWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost. At least annually, we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant and equipment, considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives. Based on our latest evaluation, effective January 2023, the estimated useful life of certain machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities will increase from 5 to 8 years. This change in estimate will be applied prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2023.Assets are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired.Identified Intangible AssetsWe amortize acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives. Acquisition-related, in-process R&D assets represent the fair value of incomplete R&D projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition; initially, these are classified as in-process R&D and are not subject to amortization. Once these R&D projects are completed, the asset balances are transferred from in-process R&D to acquisition-related developed technology and are subject to amortization from that point forward. The asset balances relating to projects that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to R&D. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements82Table of ContentsWe perform periodic reviews of significant finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. These reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Periodically, we also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. We may adjust the period over which these assets are amortized to reflect the period in which they contribute to our cash flows.GoodwillOur reporting units are the same as our operating segments. We evaluate our reporting units annually or when triggered, such as upon reorganization of our operating segments. We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The reporting unit's carrying value used in an impairment assessment represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. The impairment assessment may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.Qualitative factors used include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. We may also perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value.Our quantitative impairment assessment considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. Significant estimates include market segment growth rates, our assumed market segment share, estimated gross margins, operating expenses, and discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. These estimates change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors and could materially affect the determination of each reporting unit's fair value and potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Our quantitative assessment is sensitive to changes in underlying estimates and assumptions, the most sensitive of which is the discount rate.Our 2022 annual qualitative assessment indicated that a more detailed quantitative analysis was necessary for one of our reporting units. No impairment was required, even when considering a hypothetical increase in the discount rate of 1%, which would cause a material decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.Government IncentivesWe enter into government incentive arrangements with domestic and foreign, local, regional, and national governments, which vary in size, duration, and conditions. These arrangements allow us to maintain a market-comparable foothold across various geographies. We receive capital-related and operating grants, the benefits of which generally offset the cost of acquired capital and other expenses and are primarily structured as cash grants and non-income tax incentives. Government grants, including non-income tax incentives, are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and we will comply with the conditions specified in the grant agreement. We are eligible to receive these grants because we engage in qualifying capital investments, research and development, and other activities as defined by the relevant government entities awarding the grants. Each grant agreement requires that we comply with certain conditions, including achievement of future operational targets and committing to minimum levels of capital investment. We record capital-related grants as a reduction to property, plant and equipment, net within our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize a reduction to depreciation and amortization expense over the useful life of the corresponding acquired asset. We record operating grants as a reduction to expense in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the expenditure for which the grant is intended to compensate. Capital-related grants reduced gross property, plant and equipment by $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, of which $373 million was recognized in 2022. Contra-depreciation expense reduced cost of sales by $230 million in 2022. A majority of operating grants are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales, benefiting operating income by $104 million in 2022. Capital-related and operating grants receivables totaled $437 million as of December 31, 2022 and a substantial majority of the capital-related and operating grants receivables were reflected within other long-term assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements83Table of ContentsFair ValueWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: ▪Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.▪Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use LIBOR- and SOFR-based yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.▪Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help confirm that the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.Debt InvestmentsDebt investments include investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. Debt investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalents. Debt investments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months are classified as short-term investments, as they represent the investment of cash available for current operations. For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument, or the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net. Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level and record the interest income and realized gains or losses on the sale of these investments in interest and other, net.Unhedged debt investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews. For investments in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists by considering information about the collectability of the instrument, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. We recognize an allowance for credit losses, up to the amount of the unrealized loss when appropriate, and write down the amortized cost basis of the investment if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in interest and other, net, and unrealized losses not related to credit losses are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).Equity InvestmentsWe regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows: ▪Marketable equity securities are equity securities with RDFV that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement. ▪Non-marketable equity securities are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes.▪Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss. Our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investments is recognized on a one-quarter lag. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements84Table of ContentsRealized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted for qualifying observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates. Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investee's fair value. Qualitative factors considered include the investee's financial condition and business outlook, industry and sector performance, market for technology, operational and financing cash flow activities, and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches, which require judgment and the use of estimates, including discount rates, investee revenue and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. ▪Non-marketable equity securities are tested for impairment using a qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and property, plant and equipment. Upon determining that an impairment may exist, the security's fair value is calculated and compared to its carrying value and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.▪Equity method investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews using the other-than-temporary impairment model, which considers the severity and duration of a decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery. Impairments of equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.Derivative Financial InstrumentsOur primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. For presentation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments, including related collateral amounts, are presented at fair value on a gross basis and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities.Cash flow hedges use foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards and currency interest rate swaps, to hedge exposures for variability in the US-dollar equivalent of non-US-dollar-denominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital purchases spending.The after-tax gains or losses from the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the impact of the hedge transaction. For foreign currency contracts hedging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, and are recognized in earnings in the same income statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the cash flow hedge transactions become improbable, the corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be immediately reclassified to interest and other, net. Cash flows associated with these derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item.Fair value hedges use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the offsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other, net. Cash flows associated with these derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from financing activities.Non-designated hedges use foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, non-US-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as hedged investments, and non-US-dollar-denominated loans receivable recognized at fair value. We also use interest rate contracts to hedge interest rate risk related to our US-dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt investments classified as hedged investments. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded through earnings in the line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income to which the derivatives most closely relate, primarily in interest and other, net. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements85Table of ContentsCredit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, loans receivable, reverse repurchase agreements, and trade receivables. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty's relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy, substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December 31, 2022, our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding money market funds invested in US treasury and US agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed $2.9 billion. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our derivative counterparties and obtain and secure collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions when we deem it appropriate. Cash collateral exchanged under our collateral security arrangements is included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. For reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability unless the collateral is repledged.A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to OEMs and ODMs. We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. We believe the net accounts receivable balances from our three largest customers (53% as of December 31, 2022) do not represent a significant credit risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.Variable Interest EntitiesWe have economic interests in entities that are VIEs. If we conclude we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we are required to consolidate the entity in our financial statements. To determine if we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide services to the VIE. Periodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments in determining the fair value of the following:▪inventory; property, plant and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; and contingent consideration; each as may be applicable; ▪intangible assets, including the valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, and our assumed market segment share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;▪deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date; and▪goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies. We allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination.Employee Equity Incentive PlansWe use the straight-line amortization method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the service period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of RSUs, we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements86Table of ContentsFor the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.Income TaxesWe compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is affected by management's plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, such changes could also affect our future provision for taxes.We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for (benefit from) taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income.We recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in US taxable income as a period cost. We have recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-US earnings or for outside basis differences in our subsidiaries, because we do not plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis differences. Remittances of non-US earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-US and US operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-US earnings, which could be subject to applicable non-US income and withholding taxes. LeasesLeases consist of real property and machinery and equipment. Our lease terms may include options to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and the non-lease components are accounted for separately and not included in our leased assets and corresponding liabilities. Payments on leases may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are based on output of the underlying leased assets.Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims, liabilities related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business and are subject to change, including due to sudden or rapid developments in proceedings or claims. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously-accrued liabilities, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements87Table of ContentsNote 3 : Operating SegmentsWe previously announced several organizational changes that would accelerate the execution and innovation of our company by allowing us to capture growth in both large traditional markets and high-growth emerging markets. This includes reorganization of our business units to capture this growth and to provide increased transparency, focus, and accountability. As a result, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2022 to align to the previously announced business reorganization. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODM internally receives information and manages and monitors our operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2022.We manage our business through the following operating segments:▪Client Computing Group▪Data Center and AI▪Network and Edge ▪Mobileye▪Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics▪Intel Foundry ServicesWe derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture. CCG, DCAI, NEX and AXG are our reportable operating segments. Mobileye, and IFS do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. AXG revenue includes integrated graphics royalties from our CCG and NEX operating segments and are recorded as if the sales or transfers were to third parties at prices that approximate market-based selling prices. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment. We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments.We have an \"all other\" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:▪historical results of operations from divested businesses;  ▪results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives; ▪amounts included within restructuring and other charges;  ▪employee benefits, compensation, impairment charges, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments (beginning the first quarter of 2022, this includes all of our stock-based compensation); and ▪acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, share-based compensation, or taxes to our operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments.

While Intel Optane is a leading technology, it was not aligned to our strategic priorities. Separately, we continue to embrace the CXL standard. As a result, we recognized an inventory impairment of $723 million in cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2022. The impairment charge is recognized as a Corporate charge in the \"all other\" category presented above. As we wind down the Intel Optane business, we expect to continue to meet existing customer commitments.In 2022, our three largest customers accounted for 42% of our net revenue (43% in 2021 and 39% in 2020), with Dell Inc. accounting for 19% (21% in 2021 and 17% in 2020), Lenovo Group Limited accounting for 12% (12% in 2021 and 12% in 2020), and HP Inc. accounting for 11% (10% in 2021 and 10% in 2020).

Note 4 :Non-Controlling InterestsSemiconductor Co-Investment Program In the fourth quarter of 2022, we closed a transaction with Brookfield Asset Management (Brookfield) resulting in the formation of Arizona Fab LLC (Arizona Fab), a VIE for which we and Brookfield own 51% and 49%, respectively. Because we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we fully consolidate the results of Arizona Fab into our consolidated financial statements. Generally, contributions will be made to, and distributions will be received from, Arizona Fab based on both parties’ proportional ownership. We will be the sole operator and majority owner of two new chip factories that will be constructed by Arizona Fab, and we will have the right to purchase 100% of the related factory output. Once production commences, we will be required to operate Arizona Fab at minimum production levels measured in wafer starts per week and will be required to limit excess inventory held on site or we will be subject to certain penalties.     We have an unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of $29.0 billion. Refer to \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of the assets of Arizona Fab consisted of property, plant and equipment. The assets held by Arizona Fab, which can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE and are not available to us, were $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022.Non-controlling interest in Arizona Fab was $874 million as of December 31, 2022 and there was no net income (loss) attributable to Arizona Fab's non-controlling interest in 2022.MobileyeIn the fourth quarter of 2022, Mobileye completed its IPO and certain other equity financing transactions that resulted in net proceeds of $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2022, Intel held approximately 94% of the outstanding equity interest in Mobileye. Non-controlling interest in Mobileye was $989 million as of December 31, 2022. Net Income attributable to Mobileye's non-controlling interest was $3 million in 2022. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements90Table of ContentsNote 5 : Earnings Per ShareYears Ended (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Net income$8,017 $19,868 $20,899 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests3 — — Net income attributable to Intel$8,014 $19,868 $20,899 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding—basic4,108 4,059 4,199 Dilutive effect of employee incentive plans15 31 33 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding—diluted4,123 4,090 4,232 Earnings per share attributable to Intel—basic$1.95 $4.89 $4.98 Earnings per share attributable to Intel—diluted$1.94 $4.86 $4.94 We computed diluted earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the 2006 ESPP.During 2022, 70 million RSUs and stock options, as calculated on a weighted average basis for the year, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in the table above because they would have been anti-dilutive. These RSUs and options could potentially be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation in the future if the average market value of the common shares increases above the exercise price. For 2021 and 2020, all other periods presented, securities which would have been anti-dilutive were insignificant and have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements91Table of ContentsNote 6 : Other Financial Statement DetailsAccounts ReceivableIn 2022, we began selling certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions.

As a result of the restructuring, we established deferred tax assets and released the valuation allowances of certain foreign deferred tax assets. The majority of these deferred tax assets established in 2021 fully offset the deferred tax liabilities recognized in 2020 driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to undistributed earnings in China, as a result of the divestiture of our NAND memory business.We derive the effective tax rate benefit attributed to non-US income taxed at different rates primarily from our operations in Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, and Malaysia. The statutory tax rates in these jurisdictions range from 12.5% to 24.0%. We are subject to reduced tax rates in Israel and Malaysia as long as we conduct certain eligible activities and make certain capital investments. We have conditional reduced tax rates that expire at various dates through 2056 and we expect to apply for renewals upon expiration.

Interest, penalties, and accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in the periods presented.We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain US federal and non-US tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 could decrease by as much as $366 million in the next 12 months. We file federal, state, and non-US tax returns. Excluding pre-acquisition Altera tax years, we are no longer subject to US federal and non-US tax examinations for years prior to 2013 and 2012. For US state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2015.Note 9 : InvestmentsShort-term InvestmentsShort-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bonds and US agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, substantially all time deposits were issued by institutions outside the US. For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument or the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value with gains or losses from the investments and the related derivative instruments recorded in interest and other, net. The fair value of our hedged investments was $16.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 ($21.5 billion as of December 25, 2021). For hedged investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net losses of $748 million in 2022 (net losses of $606 million in 2021 and net gains of $694 million in 2020). Net gains on the related derivatives were $752 million in 2022 (net gains of $609 million in 2021 and net losses of $667 million in 2020).Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The adjusted cost of our unhedged investments was $10.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 ($5.0 billion as of December 25, 2021), which approximated the fair value for these periods.The fair value of marketable debt investments, by contractual maturity, as of December 31, 2022, was as follows:(In Millions)Fair ValueDue in 1 year or less$12,680 Due in 1–2 years1,844 Due in 2–5 years4,139 Due after 5 years665 Instruments not due at a single maturity date7,095 Total$26,423  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements96Table of ContentsEquity Investments(In Millions)Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Marketable equity securities1$1,341 $2,171 Non-marketable equity securities4,561 4,111 Equity method investments10 16 Total$5,912 $6,298 1    Over 90% of our marketable equity securities are subject to trading-volume or market-based restrictions, which limit the number of shares we may sell in a specified period of time, impacting our ability to liquidate these investments.

(Tower) in a cash-for-stock transaction. Tower is a leading foundry for analog semiconductor solutions. The acquisition is expected to advance our IDM 2.0 strategy by accelerating our global end-to-end systems foundry business. Upon completion of the acquisition, each issued and outstanding ordinary share of Tower will be converted into the right to receive $53 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion as of the agreement date. While we continue to work to close within the first quarter of 2023, the transaction may close in the first half of 2023, subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. If the agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will be obligated to pay Tower a termination fee of $353 million. Tower will be included in our IFS operating segment.DivestituresNAND Memory BusinessIn October 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix Inc. (SK hynix) to divest our NAND memory business for $9.0 billion in cash. The NAND memory business includes our NAND memory fabrication facility in Dalian, China and certain related equipment and tangible assets (the Fab Assets), our NAND SSD business (the NAND SSD Business), and our NAND memory technology and manufacturing business (the NAND OpCo Business). The transaction will be completed in two closings. The first closing was completed on December 29, 2021. At first closing, SK hynix paid $7.0 billion of consideration, with the remaining $2.0 billion to be received at the second closing of the transaction, expected to be no earlier than March 2025. In connection with the first closing, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.0 billion within interest and other, net, and tax expense of $495 million. Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, $583 million of the first closing consideration was deferred and will be recognized between the first and second closing within interest and other, net.At the first closing, we sold to SK hynix the Fab Assets and the NAND SSD Business and transferred certain employees, IP, and other assets related to the NAND OpCo Business to separately created wholly owned subsidiaries of Intel. The equity interest of the NAND OpCo Business will transfer to SK hynix at the second closing. In connection with the first closing, we and certain affiliates of SK hynix also entered into a NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, pursuant to which we will manufacture and sell to SK hynix NAND memory wafers to be manufactured using the Fab Assets in Dalian, China until the second closing. We have concluded, based on the terms of the transaction agreements, that the subsidiaries are VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary, because the governance structure of these entities does not allow us to direct the activities that would most significantly impact their economic performance. In line with this conclusion, we fully deconsolidated our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business, and recorded a receivable for the remaining proceeds of $1.9 billion in other long-term assets, which remains outstanding as of December 31, 2022. The carrying amounts of the major classes of NAND assets as of the first closing date included the following:(In Millions)Dec 29, 2021Inventories$941 Property, plant and equipment, net6,018 Total assets$6,959 The wafer manufacturing and sale agreement includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of the NAND OpCo Business. These incentives and penalties present a maximum exposure of up to $500 million annually, and $1.5 billion in the aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update the operating plan of the NAND OpCo Business in light of the current business environment and projections, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and penalties and our expectations of the performance of the NAND OpCo Business against those metrics. Our transactions with the NAND OpCo Business between the first and second closings are considered related party transactions due to our equity interest and the wafer manufacturing and sales agreement. Related party transactions include certain assets that transferred at first closing between Intel and the NAND OpCo Business, or costs that we incurred on behalf of the NAND OpCo Business, for which we are entitled to be reimbursed, including approximately $35 million per quarter in 2022 for corporate function services, such as human resources, information technology, finance, supply chain, and other compliance requirements associated with being wholly owned subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, we have a receivable due to Intel of $133 million recorded within other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Home Gateway Platform DivisionOn July 31, 2020, we completed the divestiture of the majority of Home Gateway Platform, a division of CCG, for proceeds of $150 million. The divestiture included the transfer of certain employees, equipment, and an ongoing supply agreement for future units. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements98Table of ContentsNote 11 : Goodwill(In Millions)Dec 25, 2021AcquisitionsOtherDec 31, 2022Client Computing$4,237 $17 $— $4,254 Data Center and AI8,595 418 — 9,013 Network and Edge2,774 35 — 2,809 Mobileye10,928 — (9)10,919 Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics429 167 — 596 All other— — — — Total$26,963 $637 $(9)$27,591 (In Millions)Dec 26, 2020AcquisitionsOtherDec 25, 2021Client Computing$4,164 $73 $— $4,237 Data Center and AI8,476 85 34 8,595 Network and Edge2,774 — — 2,774 Mobileye10,928 —— 10,928 Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics391 38— 429 All other238 — (238)— Total$26,971 $196 $(204)$26,963 As described in \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2022 to align to our previously announced business reorganization, and have retrospectively adjusted all prior-period amounts in our goodwill footnote to reflect the changes in our operating segments.

The benefits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase eligible coverage in a medical plan.As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the projected benefit obligation was $527 million and $682 million, which used the discount rates of 5.6% and 2.8%. The December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 corresponding fair value of plan assets was $501 million and $669 million.The investment strategy for US Retiree Medical Plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The assets are invested in tax-aware global equity and fixed-income long credit portfolios. Both portfolios are actively managed by external managers. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries. The tax-aware fixed-income long credit portfolio is composed of domestic securities. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 55% equity and 45% fixed-income investments. As of December 31, 2022, the majority of the US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. The remaining US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in fixed-income investments and were measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs.As of December 31, 2022, the estimated benefit payments for this plan over the next 10 years are as follows: (In Millions)202320242025202620272028-2032Postretirement medical benefits$40 $41 $41 $43 $44 $222 Pension Benefit PlansWe provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain countries, most significantly the US, Ireland, Israel, and Germany. The majority of the plans' benefits have been frozen. Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets for Pension Benefit PlansThe vested benefit obligation for a defined-benefit pension plan is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is currently entitled based on the employee's expected date of separation or retirement. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements107Table of Contents (In Millions)Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Changes in projected benefit obligation:Beginning projected benefit obligation$4,456 $4,929 Service cost58 54 Interest cost91 91 Actuarial (gain) loss(1,500)(284)Currency exchange rate changes(233)(150)Plan settlements(96)(126)Other(71)(58)Ending projected benefit obligation12,705 4,456 Changes in fair value of plan assets:Beginning fair value of plan assets2,817 2,878 Actual return on plan assets(478)145 Currency exchange rate changes(102)(63)Plan settlements(96)(126)Other(11)(17)Ending fair value of plan assets22,130 2,817 Net unfunded status$575 $1,639 Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance SheetsOther long-term assets$74 $— Other long-term liabilities$649 $1,639 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (income), before tax3$406 $1,445 Accumulated benefit obligation$2,507 $4,086 1    The projected benefit obligation was approximately 30% in the US and 70% outside of the US as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021.2    The fair value of plan assets was approximately 40% in the US and 60% outside of the US as of December 31, 2022 and approximately 50% in the US and 50% outside of the US as of December 25, 2021.3    The accumulated other comprehensive loss (income), before tax, was approximately 90% in the US and 10% outside of the US as of December 31, 2022 and approximately 30% in the US and 70% outside of the US as of December 25, 2021. Changes in actuarial gains and losses in the projected benefit obligation are generally driven by discount rate movement. We use the corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line basis.As of December 31, 2022, the accumulated benefit obligations were $0.9 billion and $1.6 billion for the US plan and non-US plans, respectively. In 2022, the US and Ireland plans were in the net asset position and the other non-US plans had projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. In 2022, the US, Ireland and Israel plans had assets in excess of accumulated benefit obligations, whereas the remaining non-US plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. As of December 25, 2021, the accumulated benefit obligations were $1.4 billion and $2.6 billion for the US plan and non-US plans, respectively, and all plans had accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.

We establish the long-term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class.FundingOur practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and regulations. Funding for the US Retiree Medical Plan is discretionary under applicable laws and regulations. Additional funding may be provided for the pension and retiree medical plans as deemed appropriate.On a worldwide basis, our pension and retiree medical plans were 81% funded as of December 31, 2022. The US Pension Plan, which accounts for 28% of the worldwide pension and retiree medical benefit obligations, was 102% funded. Funded status is not indicative of our ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to fund retirement trusts. Required pension funding for US retirement plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, which sets required minimum contributions. Cumulative company funding to the US Pension Plan currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding requirements.Net Periodic Benefit CostThe net periodic benefit cost for pension and US retiree medical benefits was $139 million in 2022 ($162 million in 2021 and $164 million in 2020).

The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 90% fixed income and 10% equity investments. During 2022, the US Pension Plan assets were invested in collective investment trust funds, which are measured at net asset value.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements109Table of ContentsNon-US Plan AssetsThe investments of the non-US plans are managed by insurance companies, pension funds, or third-party trustees, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have the discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, either through index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and to help enable sufficient pension assets to be available to pay benefits as they come due. The equity investments in the non-US plan assets are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the US, and emerging markets throughout the world. We have control over the investment strategy related to the majority of the assets measured at net asset value, which are invested in hedge funds, bond index funds and equity index funds. The target allocation of the non-US plan assets that we have control over was approximately 45% fixed income, 35% equity, and 20% hedge fund investments in 2022.Estimated Future Benefit Payments for Pension Benefit PlansAs of December 31, 2022, estimated benefit payments over the next 10 years are as follows:(In Millions)202320242025202620272028-2032Pension benefits$125 $113 $118 $126 $129 $700 Note 18 : Employee Equity Incentive PlansOur equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. Our plans include our 2006 Plan and our 2006 ESPP.Under the 2006 Plan, 946 million shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through June 2023. As of December 31, 2022, 119 million shares of common stock remained available for future grants.Under the 2006 Plan, we may grant RSUs and stock options. We grant RSUs with a service condition as well as RSUs with a market condition, performance condition, and a service condition, which we call PSUs. PSUs are granted to a group of senior officers and employees. For PSUs granted in 2022, the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting at the end of the three-year performance period will range from 0% to 200% of the target grant amount and will be determined based on our performance relative to annual targets for each year in the performance period with respect to a revenue growth metric, weighted 60%, and a cash flow from operations metric, weighted 40%. The results are then averaged at the end of the performance period. Additionally, an adjustment to the performance goals aggregate achievement percentage is based on the TSR of our common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of the S&P 500 Index over a three-year period and revenue CAGR for the three-year performance period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. As of December 31, 2022, 15 million PSUs were outstanding. PSUs vest three years from the grant date. Other RSU awards and option awards generally vest over four years from the grant date.  Share-Based CompensationShare-based compensation recognized in 2022 was $3.1 billion ($2.0 billion in 2021 and $1.9 billion in 2020). During 2022, the tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $478 million ($377 million in 2021 and $380 million in 2020).We estimate the fair value of RSUs and PSUs with a service condition or performance condition using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our shares of common stock prior to vesting. We estimate the fair value of PSUs with a market condition using a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the date of grant using historical volatility.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements110Table of ContentsRestricted Stock Units and Performance Stock UnitsWeighted average assumptions used in estimating grant values were as follows:Dec 31, 2022Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Estimated values$41.12 $50.82 $54.82 Risk-free interest rate2.2 %0.2 %0.4 %Dividend yield3.4 %2.6 %2.3 %Volatility40 %37 %30 %Summary of activities:Number ofStock Units(In Millions)Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair ValueDecember 25, 2021118.0 $51.29 Granted104.2 $41.12 Vested(50.3)$48.90 Forfeited(13.2)$48.99 December 31, 2022158.7 $45.56 Expected to vest142.7 $45.78 The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2022 was $2.0 billion ($1.7 billion in 2021 and $1.9 billion in 2020), which represents the market value of our common stock on the date that the RSUs vested. The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2022 was $2.5 billion ($1.4 billion in 2021 and $1.3 billion in 2020). The number of RSUs vested includes shares of common stock that we withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. RSUs that are expected to vest are net of estimated future forfeitures.As of December 31, 2022, unrecognized compensation costs related to RSUs granted under our equity incentive plans were $4.6 billion. We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.Stock Purchase PlanThe 2006 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. Under the 2006 ESPP, 523 million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance through August 2026. As of December 31, 2022, 200 million shares of common stock remained available for issuance.Employees purchased 27 million shares of common stock in 2022 for $931 million under the 2006 ESPP (22 million shares of common stock for $925 million in 2021 and 21 million shares of common stock for $876 million in 2020). As of December 31, 2022, unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire shares of common stock under the 2006 ESPP totaled $73 million. We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately two months. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements111Table of ContentsNote 19 : Commitments and ContingenciesLeasesWe recognized operating leased assets in other long-term assets of $487 million and corresponding accrued liabilities of $173 million, and other long-term liabilities of $236 million as of December 31, 2022. Our operating leases have remaining terms of 1 to 13 years and may include options to extend the leases for up to 36 years. The weighted average remaining lease term was 3.7 years, and the weighted average discount rate was 4.3% as of December 31, 2022, for our operating leases. Operating lease expense was $729 million in 2022 ($798 million in 2021 and $416 million in 2020), including $551 million in variable lease expense in 2022 ($620 million in 2021 and $237 million in 2020).In 2021 and 2022, we signed finance leases for supplier capacity extending over approximately 8 years. The leases will commence upon start of supplier production expected in 2023 and 2024. Prepayments of $430 million were recognized in property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2022.Discounted and undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable leases as of December 31, 2022 excluding non-lease components, were as follows:(In Millions)20232024202520262027 ThereafterTotalOperating lease payments$179 $107 $72 $34 $26 $28 $446 Finance lease payments$682 $122 $5 $— $— $— $809 Present value of lease payments$1,218 CommitmentsCommitments for capital expenditures totaled $31.0 billion as of December 31, 2022, ($27.0 billion as of December 25, 2021) a majority of which will be due within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $10.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 (approximately $12.4 billion as of December 25, 2021). Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under supply agreements and various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services relate to agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Other purchase obligations reflect the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee under the agreement. Other commitments include a $5.4 billion commitment associated with our pending acquisition of Tower and our unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of $29.0 billion of Arizona Fab in connection with the definitive agreement entered into with Brookfield. Our remaining unfunded contribution was $13.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. Legal ProceedingsWe are regularly party to various ongoing claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including those noted in this section. We have accrued a charge of $2.2 billion related to litigation involving VLSI, described below. Excluding the VLSI claims described below, management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate monetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time. European Commission Competition MatterIn 2009, the European Commission (EC) found that Intel had used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy microprocessors in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty (later renumbered Article 102) and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 by offering alleged “conditional rebates and payments” that required customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged “payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.” The EC ordered us to end the alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a €1.1 billion fine, which we paid in the third quarter of 2009.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements112Table of ContentsWe appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) rejected our appeal of the EC decision in its entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. In January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC’s 2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to us in February 2022. In April 2022, the EC appealed the General Court’s decision to the Court of Justice. A hearing date on the appeal has not been scheduled. The General Court’s January 2022 decision did not annul the EC’s 2009 finding that Intel made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products, and in January 2023 the EC reopened its administrative procedure to determine a fine against Intel based on that alleged conduct. Given the procedural posture and the nature of this proceeding, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from this matter. In a related matter, we filed applications with the General Court in April 2022 seeking an order requiring the EC to pay Intel approximately €593 million in default interest.Litigation Related to Security VulnerabilitiesIn June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available.Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel relating to Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of the security vulnerabilities that have been identified since 2018. As of January 25, 2023, consumer class action lawsuits against Intel were pending in the United States, Canada, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the United States, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor of Intel in July 2022 based on plaintiffs’ failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs have appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, and a stay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect. In Argentina, Intel Argentina was served with, and responded to, a class action complaint in June 2022. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay AnnouncementStarting in July 2020, five securities class action lawsuits were filed in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Intel and certain current and former officers based on Intel’s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent classes of acquirers of Intel stock between October 2019 and July 2020, generally allege that the defendants violated securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products in light of subsequently announced delays. In October 2020, the court consolidated the lawsuits, appointed lead plaintiffs, and in January 2021 the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint in March 2021. We dispute the claims described above and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. In July 2021, Intel introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now Intel 4.Litigation Related to Patent and IP ClaimsWe have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business.VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against Intel in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that various Intel FPGA and processor products infringe eight patents that VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). VLSI estimates its damages to be at least $5.5 billion, and seeks enhanced damages, future royalties, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements113Table of ContentsIntel filed Inter Partes Review (IPR) petitions with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) in 2018 challenging patentability, and the parties stipulated to stay the district court action pending the PTAB's review. The PTAB subsequently found all claims of two patents, and some claims of two other patents, to be unpatentable. The district court lifted the stay in September 2021 and scheduled trial for March 2024 on the claims that were found patentable by the PTAB.In June 2018, VLSI filed a second suit against Intel, in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, seeking $4.4 billion in damages for the alleged infringement by various Intel processors of five additional patents that VLSI acquired from NXP. In December 2022, VLSI stipulated to dismiss with prejudice its claims, for which Intel paid nothing. The court dismissed the case in January 2023.In April 2019, VLSI filed three infringement suits against Intel in the Western District of Texas (WDTX) accusing various Intel processors of infringement of eight additional patents it had acquired from NXP. The first Texas case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded VLSI $1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent and $675 million for infringement of another patent under the doctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding VLSI $2.2 billion in damages and approximately $162.3 million in pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. Intel has appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including its claim to have a license from Fortress Investment Group’s acquisition of Finjan. In December 2021 and January 2022 the PTAB instituted IPRs on the claims found to have been infringed in the first Texas case, but it has not yet issued a final written decision on either petition.The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that Intel does not infringe the asserted patents. VLSI had sought approximately $3.0 billion for alleged infringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet entered final judgment following the second trial in Texas. The third Texas case went to trial in November 2022, with VLSI asserting one remaining patent. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, and awarded VLSI nearly $949 million in damages, plus a running royalty. The court has not yet entered final judgment following the third trial in Texas. We intend to file motions for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and further appeals are possible.In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserts one patent against certain Intel Core processors. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) which held a hearing in September 2021. CNIPA has not yet issued a decision. The Shenzhen court held trial proceedings in July 2021 and indicated that further trial proceedings were needed but would be stayed pending the outcome of defendants’ invalidity challenge at the CNIPA. VLSI seeks an injunction as well as RMB 1.3 million in costs and expenses, but no damages. In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. asserting one patent against certain Intel core processors. The court held a trial hearing in December 2020, where VLSI requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an injunction. The court held a second trial hearing in May 2022, but has yet to issue its final decision. In December 2022, Intel filed a second petition to invalidate the patent at issue.In November 2019, Intel, along with Apple Inc., filed a complaint against Fortress Investment Group LLC, Fortress Credit Co. LLC, Uniloc 2017 LLC, Uniloc USA, Inc., Uniloc Luxembourg S.A.R.L., VLSI, INVT SPE LLC, Inventergy Global, Inc., DSS Technology Management, Inc., IXI IP, LLC, and Seven Networks, LLC. Plaintiffs allege violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act by certain defendants, Section 7 of the Clayton Act by certain defendants, and California Business and Professions Code section 17200 by all defendants based on defendants’ unlawful aggregation of patents. In September 2021, the district court dismissed the claims with prejudice, entering judgment in favor of defendants. In November 2022 the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision.Intel has accrued a charge of approximately $2.2 billion related to the VLSI litigation. While we dispute VLSI’s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts given recent developments and future proceedings.Business Interruption Insurance ProceedsWe received $484 million of insurance proceeds, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2022, to compensate for business interruption and property damage from a temporary electrical breakdown that occurred at one of our facilities in 2020.

A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on management's evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with US GAAP.Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Management's assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment.Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP. We reviewed the results of management's assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting, as stated in the firm's attestation report, which is included within Financial Statements and Supplemental Details.

We believe these investments will position us for accelerating long-term revenue growth. We expect our long-term revenue outlook to accelerate to a 10% to 12% year-over-year growth rate by the end of our five-year horizon as supply normalizes and our investments add capacity and drive leadership products. We expect gross margins to be impacted by our investments in capacity and the acceleration of our process technology, resulting in expected non-GAAP gross margins percentages between 51% and 53%2 over the next several years before moving upward. We also expect our capital expenditures to increase above historical levels for the next several years. We expect our cash from operations to be strong, but our capital investments to pressure our free cash flow in the short term.1  See \"Our Products\" within MD&A. 2  See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&A.Fundamentals of Our Business4Table of ContentsNew CEO and leadership team changesOur new CEO Pat Gelsinger joined Intel on February 15, 2021 and made several senior leadership changes throughout the year. We also named our new CFO David Zinsner in January 2022. Mr. Gelsinger returns to Intel, where he previously spent 30 years of his career, learned at the feet of Intel’s founders, and served as our first Chief Technology Officer.IDM 2.0On March 23, 2021, we announced our \"IDM 2.0\" strategy, the next evolution of our IDM model. Our IDM 2.0 strategy combines our internal factory network, strategic use of external foundries, and our new IFS business to position us to drive technology and product leadership. To accelerate this strategy, we announced plans to invest $20 billion to build two new fabs in Arizona, which we broke ground on in September, and we recently announced plans to invest more than $20 billion in the construction of two new leading-edge fabs in Ohio. We also announced approximately $10.5 billion total investment to equip our Rio Rancho, New Mexico and Malaysia sites for advanced packaging manufacturing. In August, the US Department of Defense announced that IFS will lead the first phase of its multi-phase RAMP-C program to facilitate the use of a domestic commercial foundry infrastructure.Process and packaging technology roadmapsAt the Intel Accelerated event in July 2021, we provided an update on our manufacturing process and packaging technology roadmaps. We introduced future nodes, including Intel 3 and Intel 20A, and discussed future process and packaging technologies, such as our PowerVia, RibbonFET, Foveros Omni, and Foveros Direct technologies. As part of the update, we also introduced a new naming structure for our manufacturing process nodes, which includes the name changes summarized in \"Key Terms\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.12th Gen Intel® Core™ processorsWe announced the 12th Gen Intel Core processor family (Alder Lake), the first on the Intel 7 process, with real-world performance for enthusiast gamers and professional creators. Alder Lake is the first processor based on our performance hybrid architecture featuring a combination of Performance-cores, the highest performing CPU cores Intel has built, and Efficient-cores designed for scalable multi-threaded workload performance.Ice Lake Server processorsWe launched the 3rd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable CPU (Ice Lake), which boasts up to 40 cores and delivers a significant increase in performance, on average, compared to the previous generation.

(SK hynix). We intend to invest transaction proceeds to deliver leadership products and advance our long-term growth priorities.Fundamentals of Our Business5Table of ContentsOur StrategyThe world is becoming more digital, and computing more pervasive. Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering the digitization of everything, which is being accelerated by four superpowers: ubiquitous compute, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, pervasive connectivity, and AI. Together these superpowers reinforce and amplify one another, and will exponentially increase the world’s need for computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever-smaller microchips. We intend to lead the industry by harnessing these superpowers for our customers’ growth and our own.We are uniquely positioned with the depth and breadth of our software, silicon and platforms, and packaging and process technology with at-scale manufacturing. With these strengths and the tailwinds of the superpowers, our strategy to win is focused on three key themes: product leadership, open platforms, and manufacturing at scale. Our PrioritiesProduct LeadershipLead and democratize compute with Intel x86 and xPU. Our product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from edge computing to 5G networks, the cloud, and the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, to serve an increasingly smart and connected world.At our core is the x86 computing ecosystem, which supports an extensive and deep universe of software applications, with billions of lines of code written and optimized for x86 CPUs. We continue to advance this ecosystem with x86 microarchitectures focused on performance, which push the limits of low latency and single-threaded application performance, and microarchitectures focused on efficiency, which are designed for computing throughput efficiency to enable scalable multithreaded performance. Our innovative new 12th Gen client processors (Alder Lake) combine both performance cores and efficient cores in a performance hybrid architecture that can direct workloads to the right core depending on whether they require higher performance or power efficiency. We can also combine these architectural advances with our innovations in process and packaging technology, as in our next-generation Intel Xeon data center CPU (Sapphire Rapids), which will utilize performance cores on multiple compute tiles connected through our EMIB packaging technology in a scalable design, rather than being built on a monolithic silicon die. Beyond the CPU, we are delivering a growing family of xPU products, which encompass client and data center GPUs, IPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. The xPU approach recognizes that different workloads benefit from different computing architectures, and our broad portfolio helps meet our customers' increasingly diverse computing needs. As part of our strategy, we seek to develop and offer leading products across each of these architectural categories. Our vision is that our products will help enable a future in which every human can have one petaflop of computing power and one petabyte of data less than one millisecond away.Fundamentals of Our Business6Table of ContentsOpen PlatformsWe aim to deliver open software and hardware platforms with industry-defining standards. Around the globe, companies are building their networks, systems, and solutions on open standards-based platforms. Intel has helped set the stage for this movement, with our historic contributions in developing standards such as CXL, ThunderboltTM, and PCle. We also contributed to the design, build, and validation of new open-source products in the industry such as Linux, Android, and others. The world's developers constantly innovate and expand the capabilities of these open platforms while increasing their stability, reliability, and security. In addition, microservices have enabled the development of flexible, loosely coupled services that are connected via APIs to create end-to-end processes. We use industry collaboration, co-engineering, and open-source contributions to accelerate software innovation. Through our oneAPI initiative, developers use a unified language across CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs to cut down on development time and to enhance productivity. We also deliver a steady stream of open-source code and optimizations for projects across virtually every platform and usage model. We are committed to co-engineering and jointly designing, building, and validating new products with software industry leaders to accelerate mutual technology advancements and help new software and hardware work better together. Our commitment extends to developers through our developer-first approach based on openness, choice, and trust. Manufacturing at Scale In March 2021, we introduced IDM 2.0, the next evolution and expansion of our IDM model. IDM 2.0 is a differentiated strategy that combines three capabilities:Internal factory network. Our global, internal factory network has been foundational to our success, enabling product optimization, improved economics, and supply resilience. We intend to remain a leading developer of process technology and a major manufacturer of semiconductors and will continue to build the majority of our products in our factories.Strategic use of foundry capacity. We expect to expand our use of third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, which will provide us with increased flexibility and scale to optimize our product roadmaps for cost, performance, schedule, and supply. Our use of foundry capacity will include manufacturing for a range of modular tiles on advanced process technologies. Foundry services. We intend to build a world-class foundry business to meet the growing global demand for semiconductors. We plan to differentiate our foundry offerings from those of others through a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe available for customers globally, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other ecosystem IP. We believe our IDM 2.0 strategy will enable us to deliver leading process technology and products to meet growing demand, while providing superior capacity and supply resilience and an advantageous cost structure.Delivering on our IDM 2.0 strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent from across the world. Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace where the world’s best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet.Growth ImperativeWe are investing to position the company for accelerated long-term growth, focusing on both our core businesses and our growth businesses. In our client and server businesses, our strategy is to invest to strengthen the competitiveness of our product roadmap and to explore opportunities in both client and data center adjacencies. We believe we have significant opportunities to grow and gain share in graphics; mobility, including autonomous driving; networking and edge; and foundry services. Focus on Innovation and ExecutionWe are focused on executing our product and process roadmap and accelerating our cadence of innovation. We have set a detailed process and packaging technology roadmap and announced key architectural innovations to further our goal of delivering leadership products in every area in which we compete. We are seeking to return our culture to its roots in innovation and execution, drawing on principles established by our former CEO Andy Grove that emphasize discipline and accountability.Fundamentals of Our Business7Table of ContentsOur CapitalWe deploy various forms of capital to execute our strategy in a way that seeks to reflect our corporate values, help our customers succeed, and create value for our stakeholders.

Our objective with each new generation of products is to improve user experiences and value through advances in performance, power, cost, connectivity, security, form factor, and other features. We also focus on reducing our design complexity, re-using IP, and increasing ecosystem collaboration to improve our efficiency.Process and packaging. At our Intel Accelerated event in July 2021, we provided an update on our manufacturing process and packaging technology roadmaps. As part of the update, we also introduced a new naming structure for our manufacturing process nodes, which includes the name changes summarized in \"Key Terms\". In addition, we introduced future nodes and discussed future process and packaging technologies on our roadmap. Our updates included the following: ▪We introduced further optimizations to our Intel 7 process node, which is now in production for our 12th Gen Intel Core (Alder Lake) processors.▪Intel 4 will make use of EUV to print incredibly small features using ultra-short wavelength light. Intel 4 will be used for our future Meteor Lake client processors.▪Intel 3 will leverage further FinFET optimizations and increased EUV to deliver additional performance-per-watt and area improvements over Intel 4.▪Intel 20A will follow Intel 3 and will introduce two breakthrough technologies: Ribbon FET and PowerVia. RibbonFET, Intel’s implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, will be our first new transistor architecture since we pioneered FinFET in 2011. The technology is expected to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the same drive current as multiple fins in a smaller footprint. PowerVia will be our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery, optimizing signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer.▪Beyond Intel 20A, we are developing our Intel 18A node, with expected refinements to RibbonFET to deliver additional transistor performance improvements. We are also working to define, build, and deploy next-generation High Numerical Aperture EUV in our process technology roadmap.▪Our future Foveros Omni advanced packaging technology will usher in the next generation of our 3D stacking Foveros technology, enabling us to mix multiple top die tiles with multiple base tiles across mixed fab nodes and giving us greater flexibility for disaggregated chip designs. With our future Foveros Direct technology, we will move to direct copper-to-copper bonding for low-resistance interconnects and blur the boundary between where the wafer ends and the package begins.xPU architecture. The future is a diverse mix of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial architectures deployed in CPU, GPU, accelerator, and FPGA sockets, enabled by a scalable software stack and integrated into systems by advanced packaging technology. We are building processors that span several major computing architectures, moving toward an era of heterogeneous computing: ▪CPU. We started shipping our 3rd Gen Xeon Scalable processors (Ice Lake) with the new Sunny Cove core, built-in AI acceleration, cryptographic acceleration, and advanced security capabilities. We also launched our 12th Gen Intel Core processors (Alder Lake), which will scale from thin and light laptops to enthusiast desktop and notebook platforms. They utilize the new breakthrough Performance-core (Golden Cove) and Efficient-core (Gracemont) microarchitectures and work with Intel® Thread Director for scheduling optimization.▪GPU. We announced Alchemist, our first Intel Arc branded high-performance discrete GPU family of products focused on gaming and content creation, which began shipping to OEMs in Q1 2022. We also powered on Ponte Vecchio, our discrete GPU focused on high-performance computing applications, which delivers leading floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) and compute density to accelerate AI, high-performance computing, and advanced analytics workloads. Ponte Vecchio will be released in 2022 for HPC and AI markets.▪Interconnect. Mount Evans, Intel’s first ASIC IPU, is designed to address the complexity of diverse and dispersed data centers. An IPU is designed to enable cloud and communication service providers to reduce overhead and free up performance for CPUs.▪Matrix Accelerator. Habana Gaudi accelerators are at the forefront of AI solutions for data centers. Amazon Web Services launched the EC2 DL1 instance featuring Habana Gaudi in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud for training deep learning models. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital10Table of ContentsSoftware. Software unleashes the potential of our hardware platforms across all workloads, domains, and architectures. ▪In 2021, oneAPI adoption expanded across the industry. oneAPI enables developers to build cross-architecture applications using a single code base across xPUs that take advantage of unique hardware features and lower software development and maintenance costs. Developers can choose the best architecture for the problem at hand without rewriting their entire code base, accelerating their time to value.▪We seek to accelerate adoption of oneAPI and Intel software developer tools through diverse ecosystem activities including developer trainings, summits, centers of excellence, and access to Intel hardware and software through a developer cloud. The Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI hosts global users spanning AI, data science, high-performance computing, and media & graphics and other accelerated computing workloads.▪We believe AI will be ubiquitous, and with our tools and the broad open software ecosystem, we are well-positioned to scale AI. We optimize for the most widely used AI frameworks and libraries, including TensorFlow, Pytorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, XGBoost, and Spark, with certain optimizations delivering up to 10 to 100 times performance improvements to support end-to-end AI, as well as OpenVINOTM and oneAPI AI Analytics toolkits.▪We seek to continually improve our BIOS and firmware in support of our client, data center, networking, and graphics products, including delivering simplified and cloud-optimized open firmware for data center customers through our Firmware Support Package and Minimum Platform Architecture. IP RightsWe own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. We have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire, and in some cases may be obsolete before the patents are granted. As we expand our product offerings into new areas, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties. The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.Efforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. Competitors and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see \"Risk Factors\" within Other Key Information. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.\"Here at Intel, we take pride in attracting some of the world’s best engineers, technologists, and innovators. We are advocates for a patent system that eliminates abuse by hedge funds and others who exploit weaknesses in the system to drive their profits at the expense of those of us who actually invent, create, and produce products that are central to the modern economy.\"—Steve Rodgers, Executive Vice President and General CounselManufacturing CapitalInspired by Moore's Law, a law of economics put forth by our co-founder Gordon Moore more than 50 years ago, we continuously work to advance the design and manufacturing of semiconductors to help address our customers' greatest challenges. This makes possible the innovation of new products with higher performance while balancing power efficiency, cost, and size. We continue to work across our supply chain to minimize disruptions, improve productivity, and increase overall capacity and output to meet customer expectations. In 2021, our factories performed well in a highly dynamic environment, where we adapted to rapid demand shifts and industry component shortages affecting us and our customers.Our IDM 2.0 strategy allows us to deliver leadership products through the use of internal and external capacity while leveraging our core strengths for growth via providing foundry services to others. IDM 2.0 combines three factors. First, we will continue to build the majority of our products in Intel fabs. Second, we expect our use of third party foundry capacity to grow and to include manufacturing for a range of modular tiles on advanced process technologies. Third, we intend to build a world-class foundry business with IFS, which will combine leading-edge process and packaging technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe, and a world-class IP portfolio for customers, including x86 cores. During the year we began shipping packaging units for our first IFS customer, Amazon Web Services. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital11Table of Contents“In alignment with our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are repositioning Intel for growth by increasing our investment in internal manufacturing, expanding our global capacity for supply chain resiliency, and delivering on world class manufacturing execution.”—Keyvan Esfarjani, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Operations\"Process and packaging are at the very heart of Intel’s heritage and are the foundation of everything we build. With the roadmaps we unveiled this year, we plan to accelerate our rate of innovation to reach process performance-per-watt parity by 2024 and leadership by 2025, and to maintain advanced packaging leadership.\" —Dr. Ann Kelleher, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Technology DevelopmentNetwork and Supply ChainOur global supply chain supports internal partners across architecture, product design, technology development, manufacturing and operations, sales and marketing, and business units, and our supply ecosystem comprises thousands of suppliers globally. Our mission is to enable product and process leadership, industry-leading total cost of ownership, and uninterrupted supply for our customers. In addition to our own manufacturing capacity, we continue to expand our use of third-party foundries. The majority of our logic wafer manufacturing is conducted in the US. As of our fiscal 2021 year-end, we had ten manufacturing sites — six are wafer fabrication and four are assembly/test facilities. The following map shows these factory sites and the countries where we have a significant R&D and/or sales presence. In response to COVID-19, we maintained operational changes and measures to enable a continued safe environment for our employees and operation of our manufacturing sites.Our manufacturing facilities are primarily used for silicon wafer manufacturing, assembling, and testing of our platform products. We operate in a network of manufacturing facilities integrated as one factory to provide the most flexible supply capacity, allowing us to better analyze our production costs and adapt to changes in capacity needs. Our new process technologies are transferred identically from a central development fab to each manufacturing facility. After transfer, the network of factories and the development fab collaborate to continue driving operational improvements. This enables fast ramp of the operation, fast learning, and quality control. We are expanding manufacturing capacity across multiple sites, including Arizona, Ireland, Israel, and Oregon. To accelerate our IDM 2.0 strategy, we announced plans to invest $20 billion to build two new fabs in Arizona, which we broke ground on in September, and we recently announced plans to invest more than $20 billion in the construction of two new leading-edge fabs in Ohio, while actively searching for additional manufacturing locations in Europe. Our plans include utilizing a \"smart capital\" strategy in which we focus first on aggressively building out fab shells, which are the smaller portion of the overall cost of a fab but have the longest lead time, giving us flexibility in how and when we bring additional capacity and tools online. We also announced approximately $10.5 billion total investment to equip our Rio Rancho, New Mexico and Malaysia sites for advanced packaging manufacturing.Note: The Dalian factory, presented above, was sold subsequent to year-end as part of the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND Memory business. See Note 10 : Acquisitions and Divestitures. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital12Table of ContentsHuman CapitalOur human capital strategy is grounded in our belief that our people are fundamental to our success. Delivering on our IDM 2.0 strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent from across the world. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace where the world’s best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet. We invest in our highly skilled workforce of 121,100 people through creating practices, programs and benefits that support the evolving world of work and our employees’ needs. Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our IDM 2.0 strategy. We are focused on reinvigorating our culture to strengthen our execution and accelerate our cadence of innovation. Our values—customer first, fearless innovation, results driven, one Intel, inclusion, quality, and integrity—inspire us and are key to delivering on our purpose. This year, we added a new value—results driven—as we seek to return to our roots of innovation and execution, making data-driven decisions quickly and setting disciplined goals that drive business results. All employees are responsible for upholding these values, the Intel Code of Conduct, and Intel's Global Human Rights Principles, which form the foundation of our policies and practices and ethical business culture.\"At Intel we tackle hard problems, think boldly, and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet. Our culture unleashes the diverse perspectives, experiences, and potential of our employees to drive innovation and business results for Intel and our customers.\"—Christy Pambianchi, Executive Vice President and Chief People OfficerTalent ManagementThe digitization of everything is driving growth and global demand for semiconductors. Combined with the tightening labor market and economic recovery from COVID-19, this has driven a significant increase in competition throughout the industry to attract and retain talent – especially technical talent. In 2021, we intensified our efforts to continue to attract and retain talent, including introducing new employee referral programs, expanding wellness benefits and time off, heightening our focus on revitalizing our culture, and increasing mentoring in our technical community. In 2021, our undesired turnover rate1 was 5.6%, compared to 4.0% in 2020.We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Intel an employer of choice. We offer extensive training programs and provide rotational assignment opportunities. We evolved our performance management system to support our culture evolution and increase our focus on disciplined goal setting and results. Through our annual Employee Experience Surveys and Manager Development Feedback Surveys, employees can voice their perceptions of the company, their managers, their work experience, and learning and development opportunities.InclusionDiversity and inclusion are core to Intel's values and instrumental to driving innovation and positioning us for growth. Over the past decade, we have taken actions to integrate diversity and inclusion expectations into our culture, performance and management systems, leadership expectations, and annual bonus metrics. We are proud of what we have accomplished to advance diversity and inclusion, but we recognize we still have work to do, including beyond the walls of Intel. We also recognize the additional challenges that COVID-19 has presented to our employees, including women and individuals with disabilities. Our RISE strategy and 2030 goals set our global ambitions for the rest of the decade, including doubling the number of women in senior leadership; doubling the number of underrepresented minorities in US senior leadership; and embedding inclusive leadership practices across our business. Our goals also include increasing the percentage of employees who self-identify as having a disability to 10%; and exceeding 40% representation of women in technical roles, including engineering positions and other roles with technical job requirements. To drive accountability, we continue to link a portion of our executive and employee compensation to diversity and inclusion metrics. We have committed our scale, expertise, and reach through our comprehensive RISE strategy to work with customers and other stakeholders to accelerate the adoption of inclusive business practices across industries. In 2021, we partnered with other technology companies to launch the Alliance for Global Inclusion to create and implement an Inclusion Index with unified goals and metrics. This collective effort will allow the industry to more clearly identify actions needed to advance progress on closing persistent gaps and advancing more inclusive practices in workplaces, industry, and society. We will also continue to collaborate on initiatives that expand the diverse pipeline of talent for our industry, advance social equity, make technology fully inclusive, and expand digital readiness for millions of people around the world. 1  Undesired turnover includes all regular Intel employees who voluntarily left Intel, but do not include Intel contract employees, interns, or employees who separated from Intel due to divestiture, retirement, voluntary separation packages, death, job elimination, or redeployment.2  Senior leadership refers to salary grades 10+ and equivalent grades. While we present male and female, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing  of all gender identities.3  The term underrepresented minority (URM) is used to describe diverse populations, including Black/African American, Hispanic, and Native American employees in the US.  Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital13Table of ContentsCompensation and BenefitsWe structure pay, benefits, and services to meet the varying needs of our employees. Our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave, parent reintegration, fertility assistance, flexible work schedules, sabbaticals, and on-site services. Since 2019, we have achieved gender pay equity globally and we continue to maintain race/ethnicity pay equity in the US. We achieve pay equity by closing the gap in average pay between employees of different genders or race/ethnicity in the same or similar roles after accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences, such as location, time at grade level, and tenure. We have also advanced transparency in our pay and representation data by publicly releasing our EEO-1 survey pay data since 2019. We believe that our holistic approach toward pay equity, representation, and creating an inclusive culture enables us to cultivate a workplace that helps employees develop and progress in their careers at all levels. Though flexible work schedules are part of our existing total rewards package, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to further reimagine how our employees work and collaborate. In designing the future of our workplace, we surveyed employees around the globe to inform our “hybrid-first” approach, where the majority of our employees will split their time between working remotely and in the office, with no company-wide mandate on the number of days per week employees should be on-site or how they should collaborate. Our goal is to enable remote and on-site work where it drives the best output, while ensuring our employees have equitable access to systems, resources, and opportunities that allow them to succeed. Health, Safety, and WellnessOur commitment in Intel's Environmental, Health, and Safety Policy is to provide a safe and injury-free workplace. We continually invest in programs designed to improve physical, mental, and social well-being. We provide access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs, including on-site health centers. Throughout our response to COVID-19, our priority has remained protecting the health and safety of our employees. This includes mental health, as we aim to increase awareness of and support for mental and behavioral health. In support of our 2030 goals, we will continue to build our strong safety culture and drive global expansion of our corporate wellness program through employee education and engagement activities.Social and Relationship CapitalWe are committed to engaging in corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives that support our communities and help us develop trusted relationships with our stakeholders. Proactive engagement with our stakeholders and investments in social impact initiatives, including those aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, advance our position as a leading corporate citizen and create shared value for Intel, our global supply chain, and our communities.Economic and social. The health of our business and local economies depends on continued investments in innovation. We provide high-skill, high-paying jobs around the world. Many of these are manufacturing and R&D jobs located in our own domestic and international factories. We also benefit economies through our R&D ecosystem spending, sourcing activities, consumer spending by our employees, and tax payments. We make sizable capital investments and provide leadership in public-private partnerships to spur economic growth and innovation. We engage third-party organizations to conduct analyses of the economic impact of our operations, including a US impact study in 2021 that found that for every US Intel job, Intel's economic activity in the US indirectly supports an additional 13 jobs. We stand at the forefront of new technologies that are increasingly being used to empower individuals, companies, and governments around the world to solve global challenges. We also aim to empower people through education and advance social initiatives to create career pathways into the technology industry. This has included our global Intel Digital Readiness Programs, such as AI for Youth and AI for Workforce, scaled in partnership with governments and institutions to empower individuals with digital readiness and AI skills. Additionally, we have invested in multi-year partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities in the US to increase the number of Black/African Americans who pursue electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science fields. Our employees and retirees share their expertise through volunteer initiatives in the communities where we operate, volunteering more than 1.71 million hours over the past two years. These efforts contribute to the 2030 goal we established last year to volunteer 10 million hours over a decade. COVID-19 presented challenges over the last two years for in-person volunteering, but we continued to see an outpouring of support from employees in 2021 for virtual volunteering, donations, and innovative technology projects to support our communities. In 2020 we announced the Pandemic Response Technology Initiative to combat COVID-19. We expanded the initiative in 2021 and renamed it the RISE Technology Initiative to reflect a broader platform for action. It provides an expanded channel to build deeper relationships with our customers and partners aligned with our corporate purpose and work to create shared value through our 2030 RISE strategy. Specifically, we are funding projects in areas that include using technology to improve health and safety; making technology more inclusive while expanding digital readiness; and carbon neutral computing to help address climate change. Human rights commitment. We are committed to maintaining and improving processes to avoid complicity in human rights violations related to our operations, supply chain, and products. We have established an integrated approach to managing human rights across our business, including board-level oversight and the involvement of senior-level Management Review Committees. We also meet throughout the year with external stakeholders and experts on human rights to continue to inform and evolve our human rights policies and oversight processes. While we do not always know nor can we control what products our customers create or the applications end users may develop, we do not tolerate our products being used to violate human rights. Where we become aware of a concern that our products are being used by a business partner in connection with abuses of human rights, we restrict or cease business with the third party until we have high confidence that our products are not being used to violate human rights. 1 This is a preliminary estimate. The final number will be reported in our 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility Report, to be issued later in 2022. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital14Table of ContentsSupply Chain ResponsibilityWe actively manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve overall performance and value creation for Intel, our customers, and our suppliers. To drive responsible and sustainable practices throughout our supply chain, we have robust programs to educate and engage suppliers that support our global manufacturing operations. We actively collaborate with other companies and lead industry initiatives on key issues such as improving transparency around climate and water impacts in the global electronics supply chain and, as part of our RISE strategy, we are advancing collaboration across our industry on responsible minerals sourcing. Through these efforts we help set electronics industry-wide standards, develop audit processes, and conduct training.Over the past decade, we have directly engaged with our suppliers to verify compliance and build capacity to address risks of forced and bonded labor and other human rights issues. We perform supplier audits and identify critical direct suppliers to engage through capability-building programs, which help suppliers build sustainability acumen and verify compliance with the Responsible Business Alliance and our Code of Conduct. We also engage with indirect suppliers through our programs on forced and bonded labor, responsible minerals, and supplier diversity. To achieve our 2030 RISE goals, we will significantly expand the number of suppliers covered by our engagement activities.Our commitment to diversity and inclusion also extends to our suppliers. We believe a diverse supply chain supports greater innovation and value for our business. We have set additional spending targets with women-owned suppliers outside the US and with minority-owned suppliers globally to accelerate progress toward our goal to increase global annual spending with diverse suppliers by 100% to reach $2 billion in annual spending by 2030. Continuing in 2022, we will only retain or use outside law firms in the US that are above average on diversity for their equity partners. We are applying a similar rule to firms used by our tax department, including non-legal firms.Natural CapitalDriving to the lowest possible environmental footprint as we grow helps us create efficiencies, lower costs, and respond to the needs of our stakeholders. We invest in conservation projects and set company-wide environmental targets to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, water use, and waste generation. We build energy efficiency into our products to help our customers lower their own emissions and energy costs, and we collaborate with policymakers and other stakeholders to use technology to address environmental challenges. Through our 2030 goals we will continue to drive to higher levels of operational efficiency, including a goal of a further 10% reduction in our carbon emissions on an absolute basis even as we continue to grow. In 2021, we continued to take action on emissions reduction strategies focused on emissions abatement, additional investments in renewable electricity, process and equipment optimization, and energy conservation. Our 2030 strategy and goals also focus on improving product energy efficiency and increasing our \"handprint\"—the ways in which Intel technologies can help others reduce their footprints, including Internet of Things solutions that enable intelligence in machines, buildings, supply chains, and factories, and make electrical grids smarter, safer, and more efficient. Climate and EnergyWe focus on reducing our own climate impact, and over the past two decades have reduced our direct emissions and indirect emissions associated with energy consumption. Through our 2030 goals we have committed to conserve an additional 4 billion kWh of energy over 10 years. We have conserved more than 310 million kWh1 of energy since 2020. We also continue to link a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our corporate sustainability metrics. In 2021, this included our target to save 125 million kWh of energy during the year. We also invest in green power and on-site alternative energy projects in support of our 2030 goal to achieve 100% renewable energy use across our global manufacturing operations. We have reached 81%1 renewable energy globally. We are committed to transparency around our carbon footprint and climate risk and use the framework developed by the TCFD to inform our disclosure on climate governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. For governance and strategy, we follow an integrated approach to address climate change, with multiple teams responsible for managing climate-related activities, initiatives, and policies. Strategies and progress toward goals are reviewed with senior executives and the Intel Board of Directors' Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. We describe our overall risk management processes in our Proxy Statement, and describe our climate-related risks and opportunities in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, the Intel Climate Change Policy, and \"Risk Factors\" within this Form 10-K. In addition to what is included within this Form 10-K, information about and progress toward our 2030 goals is included in our Corporate Responsibility Report. Our Corporate Responsibility Report also includes a mapping of our disclosure to the TCFD, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework, and our CDP Climate Change Survey, all of which are available on our website.2 1  This is a preliminary estimate. The final number will be reported in our 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility Report, to be issued later in 2022.2  The contents of our website and our Corporate Responsibility Report, Climate Change Policy, and CDP Climate Change Survey are referenced for general information only and are not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital15Table of ContentsWater StewardshipWater is essential to the semiconductor manufacturing process. We use ultrapure water to remove impurities from our silicon wafers, and we use fresh and reclaimed water to run our manufacturing facility systems. Through our 2030 goals, we have committed to conserve an additional 60 billion gallons in this decade. As part of this commitment, we plan to achieve net positive water use globally. We have conserved 15.4 billion gallons1 of water and enabled restoration of 3.5 billion gallons1 of water since 2020. In 2021, we linked a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our targets to conserve 7.5 billion gallons of water in our operations and complete projects to restore more than 1.5 billion gallons to local watersheds. Circular Economy and Waste ManagementWe have long been committed to waste management, recycling, and circular economy strategies that enable the recovery and productive re-use of waste streams. Our 2030 goals include a target of zero total waste2 to landfill, as well as implementation of circular economy strategies for 60% of our manufacturing waste streams in partnership with our suppliers. This can include reuse of waste streams directly in our own operations or enabling reuse of our waste streams by other industries. Our 2030 goal of 60% will be challenging, given our projected operational growth and new waste streams, suppliers, and locations that will require new circular economy strategies. We continue to focus on opportunities to upcycle waste by working further on waste segregation practices and collaborating with our suppliers to evaluate new technologies for waste recovery.'1  This is a preliminary estimate. The final number will be reported in our 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility Report, to be issued later in 2022.2 Intel defines zero waste as less than 1%. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital16Table of ContentsValue We CreateEach of our six forms of capital plays a critical role in our long-term value creation.

This trend is expected to remain in a post-pandemic world, driving a year over year growth in revenue TAM1. The ecosystem is shipping over one million PC units a day and we believe there is sustained strength in PC demand. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has driven significant behavior changes that have positioned the PC as an essential tool in people's lives. PC density, or PCs per household, is increasing as COVID-19 has irreversibly changed the way we focus, create, connect, and care for each other. In addition, we continue to see an increase in PCs per student. There is a significant opportunity in the commercial segment, driven by refresh of older Windows devices. Currently, there are approximately 140 million devices that are more than four years old2. The experience and capabilities delivered on new PCs are dramatically better today, reinforcing the opportunity to drive a refresh cycle among enterprise customers. Products and CompetitionWe operate in a particularly competitive market. In processors, we compete with AMD and vendors who design applications processors based on ARM* architecture, such as Qualcomm Inc.

Our product portfolio covers the entire stack required for assisted and autonomous driving, including compute platforms, computer vision and machine learning-based sensing, mapping and localization, driving policy, and active sensors in development. Mobileye's unique assets in ADAS allow for building a scalable self-driving stack that meets the requirements for both Robotaxi and consumer level autonomy. Our customers and strategic partners include major global OEMs, Tier 1 automotive system integrators, and public transportation operators.Key Developments■We achieved record revenue in 2021 as global vehicle production improved amid recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19. Our EyeQ SoC volume grew 42% and we expect to see additional growth in the adoption of enhanced ADAS technologies. We have shipped over 100 million chips to date, including 28 million EyeQ SoCs in 2021.\"The future of autonomous driving will be driven by the expansion of Robotaxis, followed by the proliferation of consumer level AVs. While it is too early to determine which realm will dominate, Mobileye is uniquely positioned to become a leader in both spaces.\"—Prof. Amnon Shashua, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mobileye■We secured a record 41 new ADAS design wins, including deals with major OEMs such as Toyota, VW, BMW, Nissan, Honda, and PSA Group. We are currently active in 71 production programs1 across over 30 OEMs.■We launched our SAE L4 SDS, Mobileye Drive™, and secured multiple collaborations for commercial use, including with Udelv for autonomous cargo delivery, and with Transdev for self-driving mobility services. We also achieved our first consumer L4 design win with Geely.■We unveiled the Mobileye Robotaxi, a production-grade self-driving electric vehicle, with mobility rider services and MaaS platform, as well as mobility intelligence, tele-operations and data services by Moovit. Through the partnership with SIXT, Robotaxi services will begin in Germany in 2022, along with the already announced Robotaxi services in Tel Aviv.  ■In December 2021, we announced our intention to take Mobileye public in the US via an IPO of newly issued Mobileye stock. Intel expects to retain majority ownership of Mobileye following the completion of the IPO. 5-Year Trends2  ■ Revenue $B■ Op Income $BMarket and Business OverviewMarket Trends and StrategyWhile the vehicle industry shows recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic with approximately 2%3 growth year over year, production is still roughly 15% below 2019 levels. We expect ADAS volume to overcome the COVID-19 effects faster than overall global vehicle production, given the significant growth shown in 2021. We anticipate long-term ADAS growth from a strong build-up in L1-L2 ADAS fitment rates, increasing the number of vehicles that will have basic ADAS features from the factory. In addition, we expect increased demand for new generations of cloud-enhanced ADAS as OEMs continue to look to boost current L2 solutions by improving system fidelity, availability, and performance. A crucial building block for L4 autonomy, our REM high-definition maps with constant updates, global coverage, and crowd-based semantics provide a unique value proposition for enhanced L2 systems. We see great traction from leading OEMs (including VW and Ford, as recently announced) as REM-based enhancements can be achieved based on economical configuration. We believe the future of autonomous driving will unfold in two phases: commercial services like Robotaxi and cargo, followed by series-production passenger car consumer AVs. We expect consumer AVs to materialize only after the Robotaxi industry deploys and matures. The main inhibitors of a mass market product offering of consumer AV are the cost of AV technology, ability to scale at a low cost, regulatory framework, public acceptance, and the ability to scale geographically. Thus, we see the Robotaxi phase as a necessary corridor to consumer AV. Because of our scalable approach, Mobileye is well-positioned to play a significant role in both the Robotaxi market and the future consumer AV market. This is driven by three elements in our strategy: lean compute enabled by the tight co-design of hardware and software, REM crowdsourced maps that provide unparalleled global coverage and constant updates, and development of high-resolution imaging radars to reduce the use of costly LiDAR sensors.1 This refers to the total number of production programs with active project managers. Intel's definition of program is included in \"Key Terms\" within the Financial Statements and Supplemental Details. 2  Mobileye was acquired in Q3 2017; 2017 results do not represent the full year. 3  Source: IHS Markit.MD&A28Table of ContentsIn Robotaxi, Mobileye is active via two major business models: First, we are positioning ourselves to be an end-to-end service provider together with Moovit's complementary go-to-market assets and service layers. Second, we are also engaging with various public transportation operators, goods delivery, and mobility providers via a Vehicle-as-a-Service business model in which we provide a fully integrated self-driving platform. Regulatory approval and framework are a prerequisite for AV proliferation. In 2021, Germany became the first country in the world to allow autonomous vehicles onto public roads without requiring a human backup safety driver behind the wheel. We anticipate one or more additional countries will soon provide similar regulation, enabling regular deployment and operation of MaaS fleets with self-driving vehicles starting in 2022.Products and CompetitionOur offering for ADAS and AV is propelled by our computer vision, AI expertise, and software assets, deployed on our EyeQ SoC family. The tight co-design of hardware and software gives the EyeQ SoC the ability to support complex and computationally intense tasks and sets it apart from competition because it is purpose-fit for high-compute, low-power, automotive-compliant mission profiles. Our 5th Gen EyeQ5 SoC is designed to act as the core building block of central compute for fully autonomous driving vehicles. We have been able to achieve power, performance, and cost targets by employing proprietary computational cores that are optimized for a wide variety of computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning tasks, including deep neural networks. Starting with EyeQ5, we are supporting an automotive-grade standard operating system and providing a complete software development kit to allow customers to differentiate their solutions by deploying their algorithms on EyeQ5. The EyeQ5 SoC is already available for commercial vehicles and is already operational in our autonomous test vehicles.EyeQ5 serves as the computational foundation for our scalable camera-only surround sensing system. The system consists of multiple independent computer vision engines and deep networks for algorithmic redundancy. The result is a robust and comprehensive model of the environment that allows end-to-end autonomous driving. The surround computer vision system is the backbone of Mobileye's AV architecture and the flagship offering for next-generation ADAS.We recently introduced EyeQ6L and EyeQ6H, which are designed to provide a scalable solution from entry level ADAS to L2+ and L4 systems. The EyeQ6 platform opens Mobileye to host and process parking and DMS data. EyeQ6L is expected to be deployed in 2023, while EyeQ6H will start production in 2024.We also introduced the EyeQ® Ultra™, our most advanced, highest performing SoC purpose-built for autonomous driving. EyeQ Ultra maximizes both performance and efficiency at 176 tera operations per second. This efficiently designed SoC builds on six generations of proven EyeQ architecture and four classes of proprietary accelerator cores to deliver the power and performance needed for AVs. The first silicon for the EyeQ Ultra SoC is expected at the end of 2023, with full automotive-grade production in 2025.The next significant building block in our complete offering is REM mapping technology, which compiles crowdsourced mapping data from EyeQ SoC-equipped vehicles. Together with our OEM partners, we are utilizing our strong presence in ADAS to gain crowd knowledge that is required for building AV maps. After five years of intense development, the REM technology is fully functional for L2/L2+ applications and provides a variety of advanced features, including predictive adaptive cruise control, lane-level localization in all weather and road conditions, hands-free driving application, and real-time alerts. REM also provides intelligent speed adaptation functionality for regulation required by GSR and EUNCAP starting in 2022. REM technology is one of our key differentiators.The third building block in our full stack offering is our unique formal model for AV safety (RSS). At its core, RSS is a pragmatic method to design and then efficiently validate the safety of an AV, serving as the governing safety layer for the decision-making system. RSS formalizes human decision making for safe driving. It acknowledges the need to balance safety with useful driving by making plausible worst-case scenario assumptions for other road users. By using induction and analytical calculations, the RSS model allows for a lean driving policy with high computational efficiency. The fourth building block is True Redundancy™, which manifests our approach to AV sensing. True Redundancy combines two independent perception sub-systems—one powered by cameras, and another by radar and LiDAR—and supports full end-to-end autonomous capabilities. Our Level 4 self-driving system, Mobileye Drive, incorporates both systems.Our last building block is active sensors development. Mobileye and Intel's combined competencies put us in a unique position to advance with the development of a software-defined imaging radar designed to deliver rich point cloud modeling capabilities to enable sensing-state and driving decisions solely on radar. Our imaging radars would replace most of the field of view covered by today's costly LiDARs. LiDAR would be retained only for the front-facing field of view, where it would operate in three-way redundancy with cameras and radar, enabling a major cost reduction for the entire sensor configuration. The proof of concept and modelling using this new radar technology has already been demonstrated. We are also developing a unique Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave LiDAR designed to provide high point density with relative speed measurement and superior immunity for additional safety in time-critical decisions.MD&A29Table of ContentsFinancial PerformanceInternet of Things Revenue $BInternet of Things Op Income $B■ IOTG ■ MobileyeRevenue Summary2021 vs. 2020IOTG revenue increased $991 million, primarily driven by $1.1 billion related to higher demand for IOTG platform products amid recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19, partially offset by $115 million due to lower ASPs.Mobileye revenue increased $419 million, driven by improvement in global vehicle production, recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19, and increasing adoption of ADAS compared to 2020.2020 vs. 2019IOTG revenue decreased $814 million, or 21%, primarily driven by the economic impacts of COVID-19 with $470 million in lower ASPs driven by weaker core mix and $265 million driven by weaker demand for IOTG platform products.

Intel FPGA-based IPU platforms are currently deployed at multiple cloud service providers. We also announced Oak Springs Canyon, an IPU reference platform built with our Intel Xeon D processor and our Intel Agilex FPGA.MD&A35Table of ContentsFinancial PerformancePSG Revenue $BPSG Operating Income $BRevenue Summary2021 vs. 2020Revenue increased $81 million, driven by recovery in the embedded and communications market segments from COVID-19 lows, partially offset by customer inventory digestion in the cloud market segment.2020 vs. 2019Revenue decreased $134 million, driven by a decline in our communications market segment due to customer transition to 5G ASICs that benefited DCG adjacencies, and decline in our embedded market segment.

CCG revenue grew 1% due to continued strength in notebook demand and recovery in desktop demand, partially offset by lower notebook ASPs due to strength in the consumer and education market segments. CCG adjacent revenue decreased primarily due to the continued ramp down from the exit of our 5G smartphone modem and Home Gateway Platform businesses. IOTG and Mobileye were both up 33% and 43%, respectively, on higher demand amid recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19. DCG revenue decreased 1% primarily due to lower ASPs driven by product mix and a competitive environment, partially offset by higher platform volume from recovery in the enterprise and government market segment. NSG revenue decreased primarily driven by lower ASPs due to market softness and pricing pressure. Our \"all other\" revenue increased primarily due to $584 million from a prepaid customer supply agreement settled in Q1 2021 for which we recognized related revenue for completing performance.We saw impacts from ongoing industry component, substrate, and foundry silicon shortages across a majority of our businesses and we expect these constraints to continue. 2020 vs. 2019In 2020, revenue was $77.9 billion, up $5.9 billion, or 8%, from 2019. Our DCG revenue grew 11% due to increased platform volume as cloud service providers increased capacity to serve customer demand. We also saw continued growth in DCG communications service providers, partially offset by enterprise and government decline. We saw growth in DCG adjacencies driven by 5G networking deployment and saw improved NAND pricing and higher demand in NSG, partially offset by weaker core mix and higher demand in IOTG platform products due to COVID-19. Our CCG revenue was up 8% year over year driven by strength in notebook and Wi-Fi sales. That growth was slightly offset by lower desktop volume and lower notebook ASPs resulting from higher demand for consumer and education PCs, and volume decline in LTE modem and connected home following the exit of those businesses. MD&A38Table of ContentsGross MarginWe derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars from the sale of platform products in the CCG and DCG operating segments. Our overall gross margin dollars in 2021 increased by $203 million, or approximately flat compared to 2020, and in 2020 increased by $1.5 billion, or 3%, compared to 2019. Our gross margin percentage was down as the increase in platform revenue was offset by higher period charges and higher unit cost.Gross Margin $B(Percentages in chart indicate gross margin as a percentage of total revenue) (In Millions)$43,815 2021 Gross Margin1,010 Higher gross margin from platform revenue680 Higher gross margin from adjacent businesses primarily due to the absence of depreciation expense from NAND property, plant and equipment that was held for sale, increased Mobileye volume and higher margins on wireless and connectivity585 Prepaid customer supply agreement settled and recognized to revenue in Q1 202175 Lower period charges driven by a decrease in engineering samples and lower reserves taken on non-qualified platform products compared to 2020, partially offset by 2020 sell-through of other reserves and other reserves taken in 2021(1,325)Higher period charges primarily associated with the ramp up of Intel 4(515)Higher period charges primarily associated with the ramp down of 14nm(235)Higher platform unit cost primarily from increased mix of 10nm SuperFin products(72)Other$43,612 2020 Gross Margin2,360 Higher gross margin from platform revenue1,855 Higher gross margin from adjacent businesses primarily due to higher margins on NAND, modem, and WIFI, partially offset by lower margins on DCG adjacencies630 Lower factory start-up costs associated with our 10nm process technology155 Lower period charges(3,285)Higher platform unit cost primarily from increased mix of 10nm products(255)Primarily driven by higher logistic expenses due to COVID-1912 Other$42,140 2019 Gross MarginMD&A39Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesTotal R&D and MG&A expenses for 2021 were $21.7 billion, up 10% compared to 2020.

In the first quarter of 2021, we recognized $471 million in observable price adjustments in our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd.In sale of equity investments and other, we recognized $447 million of initial fair value adjustments related to four companies that went public in 2021; in 2020 we recognized $1.1 billion from Montage becoming marketable and $606 million related to four other equity investments that went public. During 2021, we recognized McAfee Corp. (McAfee) dividends of $1.3 billion, which included a special dividend of $1.1 billion paid in connection with the sale of McAfee's Enterprise Business to Symphony Technology Group, and recognized $228 million related to the partial sale of our investment in McAfee. We recognized McAfee dividends of $126 million in 2020 and $632 million in 2019. In November 2021, McAfee announced an agreement to be acquired by an investor group, which is subject to closing conditions.Interest and Other, NetThe net loss in interest and other, net in 2021 was relatively flat compared to 2020.We recognized a net loss in interest and other, net in 2020 compared to a net gain in 2019, primarily due to lower divestiture gains in 2020 compared to 2019.Provision for TaxesYears Ended (Dollars in Millions)Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Income before taxes$21,703 $25,078 $24,058 Provision for taxes$1,835 $4,179 $3,010 Effective tax rate8.5 %16.7 %12.5 %MD&A41Table of ContentsOur effective tax rate decreased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by one-time tax benefits due to the restructuring of certain non-US subsidiaries as well as a higher proportion of our income in non-US jurisdictions. As a result of the restructuring, we established deferred tax assets and released the valuation allowances of certain foreign deferred tax assets. The majority of these deferred tax assets established in 2021 fully offset the deferred tax liabilities recognized in 2020 driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to undistributed earnings in China, as a result of our planned divestiture of our NAND memory business. Our effective tax rate increased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to undistributed earnings in China, as a result of our planned divestiture of our NAND memory business. It also increased due to the reduction in our foreign derived intangible income benefit in 2020.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, supplemented by our total cash and investments1, is our primary source of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. Our short-term requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; and potential acquisitions, strategic investments, and dividends. Our long-term requirements incrementally contemplate additional investments in the significant manufacturing expansion plans we announced as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy and additional investments to accelerate our process technology. These plans include investment to build two new fabs in Arizona as well as plans for a next phase of capacity expansions in Ohio, Europe, and other global locations. Our plans include utilizing a \"smart capital\" strategy in which we focus first on aggressively building out fab shells, which are the smaller portion of the overall cost of a fab but have the longest lead time, giving us flexibility in how and when we bring additional capacity and tools online. Additionally, as we have faced industry shortages of substrates and other components, we have increasingly entered into long-term agreements with suppliers and foundry service providers, some of which involve prepayments that will help us secure future supply. As we invest in these expansions and in the acceleration of our process technology roadmap, we expect our capital expenditures to increase above historical levels for the next several years. The prepayments for future supply of substrates and other components accelerate cash outflows into the near term, and we expect to apply the prepayments to future purchases, resulting in a positive impact on our liquidity in subsequent periods. We expect our capital expenditures to increase above historical levels for the next several years. As of December 25, 2021 we had commitments for capital expenditures of $22.3 billion for 2022, and we expect our total capital expenditures for 2022 to be above that amount. We also had $4.6 billion in capital expenditures committed in the long term. As of December 25, 2021, other purchase obligations and commitments in 2022 under our binding commitments for purchases of goods and services were $3.1 billion with an additional $9.3 billion committed in the long term.We have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures and other purchase obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. For example, see \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our lease obligations, which include supply agreements structured as leases, \"Note 8: Income Taxes\" within Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our tax obligations related to Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings, and \"Note 13: Borrowings\" within Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our long-term debt obligations. The expected timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition, some of our purchasing requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included in the amounts above. For example, some of these requirements are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by vendors on a purchase order basis within short time horizons.We anticipate that we will continue to primarily rely on operating cash flows, supplemented by our total cash and investments1, to fund IDM 2.0 and other cash requirements in the ordinary course of business. We also expect to benefit from government incentives under pending legislation, and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our IDM 2.0 investments. Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements. We expect our increased capital investments to pressure our free cash flow in the short term. When assessing our current sources of liquidity, we include our total cash and investments1 as shown in the following table: (In Millions)Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Cash and cash equivalents$4,827 $5,865 Short-term investments2,103 2,292 Trading assets21,483 15,738 Other long-term investments840 2,192 Loans receivable and other240 947 Total cash and investments1$29,493 $27,034 Total debt$38,101 $36,401 1  See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&A.MD&A42Table of ContentsOther potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. During 2021, we issued a total of $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, and entered into a $5.0 billion variable-rate revolving credit facility that matures in March 2026. We repaid $500 million of our 1.70% senior notes that matured in May 2021 and $2.0 billion of our 3.30% senior notes that matured in October 2021. As of December 25, 2021, we had no outstanding commercial paper or borrowing on the revolving credit facility.We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in investment-grade securities.In the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased the remaining $2.4 billion in shares of our planned $20.0 billion share repurchases announced in October 2019. We expect our future stock repurchases to be significantly below our levels from the last few years. Sources and Uses of Cash(In Millions)MD&A43Table of ContentsIn summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Net cash provided by operating activities$29,991 $35,384 $33,145 Net cash used for investing activities(25,167)(20,796)(14,405)Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities(5,862)(12,917)(17,565)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(1,038)$1,671 $1,175 Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.For 2021 compared to 2020, the $5.4 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a decrease in net working capital contributions and cash paid to settle a prepaid customer supply agreement in Q1 2021, partially offset by a McAfee special dividend received in Q3 2021.For 2020 compared to 2019, the $2.2 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were driven by accounts receivable, inventory, and income taxes, offset by other assets and liabilities.Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals, and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were $18.7 billion in 2021 ($14.3 billion in 2020 and $16.2 billion in 2019). The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale debt investments.The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in purchases of available-for-sale debt investments and trading assets, offset by an increase in maturities and sales of available-for-sale debt investments and trading assets, and a decrease in capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions.Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.The decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of common stock and a decrease in repayments of debt and debt conversions, partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by long-term debt issuances.During 2021, we repurchased $2.4 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, compared to $14.2 billion in 2020. Our total dividend payments were $5.6 billion in 2021 compared to $5.6 billion in 2020. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 117 quarters. The decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by long-term debt issuances, offset by an increase in repayments of debt and debt conversions and an increase in repurchases of common stock.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the judgment was made, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our Consolidated Financial Statements. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was made.MD&A44Table of ContentsRefer to \"Note 2: Accounting Policies\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates and policies, which are as follows:▪Inventories—the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory, excluding factory excess capacity costs. Inventory reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering future demand and market conditions; ▪Long-lived assets—the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment of property, plant and equipment, identified intangibles, and goodwill, including the determination of asset groupings and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units;▪Non-marketable equity investments—the valuation estimates and assessment of impairment and observable price adjustments; and▪Loss contingencies—the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our annual cash bonus plan.Long-term gross margin outlook range is provided on a non-GAAP basis and excludes the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and share-based compensation expense. We are unable to provide a full reconciliation of this measure to the corresponding GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, as the amount and timing of such adjustments on a long-term basis are subject to considerable uncertainty. We believe such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects where applicable. Income tax effects have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate for each adjustment. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.Non-GAAP adjustment or measureDefinition Usefulness to management and investorsNAND memory businessOur NAND memory business is subject to a pending sale to SK hynix, as announced in October 2020. While the second closing of the sale is still pending, we completed the first closing on December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. We will fully deconsolidate our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022. We exclude the impact of our NAND memory business in certain non-GAAP measures. While the second closing of the sale is still pending and subject to closing conditions, management does not currently view the business as part of the company’s core operations or its long-term strategic direction. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of the company’s core business model and how management currently evaluates core operational performance. We believe they also provide investors with an additional means to understand the potential impact of the divestiture over time. In making these adjustments, we have not made any changes to our methods for measuring and calculating revenue or other financial statement amounts.Acquisition-related adjustmentsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years.We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.MD&A45Table of ContentsNon-GAAP adjustment or measureDefinition Usefulness to management and investorsRestructuring and other chargesRestructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges include a charge related to the VLSI litigation, goodwill and asset impairments, pension charges, and costs associated with restructuring activity.We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our core operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.(Gains) losses from divestitureGains or losses are recognized in connection with a divestiture.We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because they do not reflect our current operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.Ongoing mark-to-market on marketable equity securitiesAfter the initial mark-to-market adjustment is recorded upon a security becoming marketable, gains and losses are recognized from ongoing mark-to-market adjustments of our marketable equity securities. We exclude these ongoing gains and losses for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we do not believe this volatility correlates to our core operational performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results. Free cash flowWe reference a non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow, which is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings. Free cash flow is operating cash flow adjusted to exclude additions to property, plant and equipment.This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in understanding our capital requirements and provides an additional means to evaluate the cash flow trends of our business. We exclude additions to held for sale NAND property, plant and equipment because the additions are not representative of our long-term capital requirements and these assets were sold upon the first closing of the transaction that occurred on December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. Total cash and investmentsTotal cash and investments is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity, which includes cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trading assets, other long-term investments, and loans receivable and other.This non-GAAP measure is helpful in understanding our capital resources and liquidity position.MD&A46Table of ContentsFollowing are the reconciliations of our most comparable US GAAP measures to our non-GAAP measures presented:Years Ended (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Net revenue$79,024 $77,867 $71,965 NAND memory business(4,306)(4,967)(4,059)Non-GAAP net revenue$74,718 $72,900 $67,906 Operating income$19,456 $23,678 $22,035 Acquisition-related adjustments1,492 1,416 1,324 Restructuring and other charges2,626 198 393 NAND memory business(1,369)(937)600 Non-GAAP operating income$22,205 $24,355 $24,352 Operating margin24.6 %30.4 %30.6 %Acquisition-related adjustments1.9 %1.8 %1.8 %Restructuring and other charges3.3 %0.3 %0.5 %NAND memory business(0.1)%0.9 %2.9 %Non-GAAP operating margin29.7 %33.4 %35.9 %Earnings per share—diluted$4.86 $4.94 $4.71 Acquisition-related adjustments0.36 0.33 0.29 Restructuring and other charges0.65 0.05 0.09 (Gains) losses from divestiture— — (0.16)Ongoing mark-to-market on marketable equity securities 0.03 0.03 (0.06)NAND memory business(0.33)(0.22)0.13 Income tax effects(0.10)(0.03)(0.03)Non-GAAP earnings per share—diluted$5.47 $5.10 $4.97 Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Dec 29, 2018Dec 30, 2017Net cash provided by operating activities$29,991 $35,384 $33,145 $29,432 $22,110 Additions to property, plant and equipment(18,733)(14,259)(16,213)(15,181)(11,778)Free cash flow$11,258 $21,125 $16,932 $14,251 $10,332 Net cash used for investing activities$(25,167)$(20,796)$(14,405)$(11,239)$(15,762)Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities$(5,862)$(12,917)$(17,565)$(18,607)$(8,475)MD&A47Table of ContentsOther Key InformationSales and MarketingCustomersWe sell our products primarily to OEMs, ODMs, and cloud service providers.

In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers, who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers; systems builders that purchase Intel processors and other products from our distributors. We have incentive programs that allow distributors to sell our microprocessors and other products in small quantities to systems integrators. Our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets.Sales ArrangementsOur products are sold through distribution channels throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. Because our customers generally order from us on a purchase order basis, they can typically cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.In accordance with contract terms, revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed upon shipping terms.  Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, usually 30 days after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors can exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. DistributionDistributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.Seasonal TrendsHistorically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. In 2021, continued strong COVID-driven notebook demand in the first half of the year contributed to a flatter trend than we historically observe. MarketingOur global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, differentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives preference with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Atom, Celeron®, Pentium®, and Intel Xeon trademarks make up our key CPU brands. This year, we introduced the Intel Arc brand for our upcoming high-performance graphics products.Other Key Information48Table of ContentsWe promote brand awareness and preference, and generate demand through our own direct marketing, as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press relations. We market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for our products. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as connectivity.Certain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs. These cooperative advertising and marketing programs broaden the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Certain customers are licensed to place Intel® logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to customers meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not eliminate, the impacts of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange RatesWe are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-US-dollar-denominated investments in debt and equity instruments and loans receivable, and may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-US-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. We are exposed to currency exchange risks from our non-US-dollar-denominated debt indebtedness and may use foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage this risk.Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in US dollars. However, a significant portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies, primarily the European Union euro, the Israeli shekel, the Malaysian ringgit, the Japanese yen, and the Chinese yuan. We have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-US dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-US dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards or option contracts in these hedging programs. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 10% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions outstanding as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, would result in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $38 million and less than $61 million, respectively.Interest RatesWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and provide financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally track the US dollar three-month LIBOR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into US dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns. We also enter into swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into floating-rate coupon payments for our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.A hypothetical increase in benchmark interest rates of 1%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $68 million as of December 25, 2021 (a hypothetical decrease of 1% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $75 million as of December 26, 2020).Taking into account floating-rate debt and fixed-rate debt that is swapped to floating-rate debt, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 1% would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $132 million from debt outstanding as of December 25, 2021 (a hypothetical increase of 1% would have resulted in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $132 million from debt outstanding as of December 26, 2020). Equity PricesWe are exposed to equity market risk through our investments in marketable equity securities, which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activities. Other Key Information49Table of ContentsAs of December 25, 2021, the fair value of our marketable equity securities was $2.2 billion ($1.8 billion as of December 26, 2020). The substantial majority of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of December 25, 2021 was concentrated in securities traded on the Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity securities, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio. Assuming a decline of 60% in market prices, the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by approximately $1.3 billion, based on the value as of December 25, 2021 (a decrease in value of approximately $1.1 billion, based on the value as of December 26, 2020 using an assumed decline of 60%). We utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities.Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $4.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 ($3.3 billion as of December 26, 2020) and includes our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. of $1.1 billion ($658 million as of December 26, 2020). Commodity Price RiskAlthough we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities. Risk FactorsWhen any one or more of the following risks materialize from time to time, our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations can be materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations can also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including in the MD&A and Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.Changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results. Demand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our products varies within or among them. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, we expect the PC TAM to grow over time driven by factors such as a larger installed base, new platforms, shorter replacement cycles, and adoption in new markets; however, the PC industry has been highly cyclical in the past, and these growth expectations may not materialize or we may fail to capitalize on them. Changes in the demand for our products, particularly our CCG and DCG platform products, can reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.Important factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:▪business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;▪consumer confidence, income levels, and customer capital spending, which can be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing or spending, taxation, interest rates, the credit market, current or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;▪geopolitical conditions, including trade policies;▪our ability to timely introduce competitive products; ▪competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;▪the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;▪customer order patterns and order cancellations, including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products, customers' products, and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles; and disruptions affecting customers, such as the ongoing industry substrate and component shortages that negatively impacted demand across several of our businesses in 2021;▪market acceptance and industry support of our products, including the introduction and availability of software and other products used together with our products; and▪customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user computing workloads, such as work- and learn-from-home trends.Other Key Information50Table of ContentsDue to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we are not always able to timely respond to fluctuations in demand and we may incur significant charges and costs. Because we own and operate high-tech fabrication facilities, our operations have high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to utilization of existing facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. As we make substantial investments in increasing our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, these underutilization risks may be heightened.  Conversely, at times demand increases or we fail to forecast accurately or produce the mix of products demanded. To the extent we are unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough, we are at times required to make production decisions and/or are unable to fully meet market demand, which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships. Our IDM 2.0 investments in capacity and our process technology roadmap will require capital expenditures above our historical levels, and if demand for our IFS business grows rapidly, we anticipate that we would need to accelerate our planned investments to meet that demand. To the extent we do not generate expected cash flows, we may be required to increase our use of external funding sources to fund our investments and operations, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. There is legislation under consideration in the US and EU to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions, but there can be no assurance that such funding will be enacted, and there is uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of funding we may receive and as to any restrictions on recipients. To the extent such funding is below our expectations, our anticipated cash requirements would increase.  Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects.We face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments; changes in industry standards; changes in customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent product introductions and improvements. When we do not anticipate or respond to these developments, our competitive position can weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has intensified, and we expect it to continue to do so in the future.Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by product and market segment. For example, our competitors have introduced data center and client platform products with performance improvements and additional processor core counts that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment. In our IOTG business, for example, interoperability, connectivity, safety, security, industrial use conditions, and long-life support are among the key competitive factors. To the extent our products do not meet our customers' requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape, our business and results of operation can be harmed.We face intense competition across our product portfolio from companies offering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; accelerator products such as GPUs, including those offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity and networking products; and other semiconductor products. Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms, such as the ARM architecture, and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. For example, ARM-based products are being used in PCs and servers, which could lead to further development and growth of the ARM ecosystem. We also compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers. Some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads. For example, in 2020, Apple introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in place of our client CPUs, and we face increasing competition from Apple's products and ecosystem.Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (TSMC) or Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and subcontractors for manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products. Manufacturing process improvements introduced by TSMC have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to increasingly competitive offerings by our competitors. While we have set out a process technology roadmap to attain future process performance-per-watt parity and leadership relative to TSMC, our plans are subject to a number of risks and we could fail to realize our goals, including due to changes in competitor technology roadmaps, changes affecting our projections regarding our technology or competing technology, and the risks described in the section \"We are vulnerable to product and manufacturing-related risks.\" As an IDM, we have higher capital expenditures and R&D spending than many of our \"fabless\" competitors. We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or business collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which could have a significant impact on our competitive position. For example, we could face increased competition as a result of China's programs to promote a domestic semiconductor industry and supply chains.Other Key Information51Table of ContentsIntroduction of competitive new products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products, exert downward pricing pressure on our products, and adversely affect our business. For example, our DCG revenue and platform ASPs were negatively impacted by the competitive environment during 2021. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. For example, in 2020, NVIDIA announced an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings plc, and AMD announced an agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.If we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.We invest significantly in R&D, and to the extent our R&D efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position can be harmed and we may not realize a return on our investments. To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, and improve our existing products and processes, all ahead of competitors. We are focusing our R&D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. We cannot guarantee that all of these efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. To the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, and/or transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we can face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages. In addition, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. To the extent our R&D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product.We do not expect all of our R&D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products and technologies fail or fall short of our expectations, or are not well-received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant investments in R&D, and we expect our investments to grow as we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy. Our investments at times do not contribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Our investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. We have entered new areas and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by ubiquitous computing, cloud to edge infrastructure, pervasive connectivity, and AI. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU products, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel Optane technology products. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have announced plans to become a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, establishing IFS. IFS faces competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC and Samsung, and to succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; manufacturing capacity; price; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Our \"big bets\" are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business, one of our prior big bets, based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for the business. These new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.Other Key Information52Table of ContentsChanges in the mix of products sold can materially impact our financial results. Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our platform product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based on Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon processors. Our adjacent products also typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced platform products, and at times are not profitable. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platform products in any of our market segments, or our adjacent products represent a greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross margin percentage may decrease.We are vulnerable to product and manufacturing-related risks.We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing technologies. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the development of next-generation process technologies at increasingly advanced nodes as we seek to realize the benefits of Moore's Law. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials or new production equipment, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes, and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially understood. We are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology, and in 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) that resulted in delays relative to our prior expectations. These delays have allowed competitors using third-party foundries such as TSMC to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us by foundries, including improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which have helped increase the competitiveness of their products. Because of these prior delays in our process technologies, we may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products. Our efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process and packaging technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance of the technology introduction. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost, performance, power, and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&D investments, particularly as development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses.Risks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, failure to achieve expected performance, power, and area improvements, and product defects and errata. Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs and adversely affect our gross margins, and can contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. A new process node typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields, and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes. As the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields.From time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising permits and licenses, interruptions in our supply of materials, resources, or production equipment, adverse changes in equipment productivity, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations. In addition, delays in our product introductions can cause us to become less competitive and lose revenue opportunities, and our gross margin could be adversely affected because we incur significant costs up front in the product development stage and earn revenue to offset these costs over time.We face supply chain risks. We have a highly complex global supply chain composed of thousands of suppliers. These suppliers provide direct materials for our production processes; supply tools, equipment, and IP for our factories; deliver logistics and packaging services; and supply software, lab and office equipment, and other goods and services used in our business. We also rely on suppliers to provide certain components for our products and to manufacture and assemble and test some of our components and products. From time to time we are negatively impacted by supply chain issues, including the following:▪suppliers extending lead times, experiencing capacity constraints, limiting or canceling supply, allocating supply to other customers including competitors, delaying or canceling deliveries, or increasing prices;▪supplier quality issues;▪cybersecurity events, IP or other litigation, manmade or natural disasters, operational failures, or other events that disrupt suppliers;▪long lead times to qualify alternate or additional suppliers, or the unavailability of qualified alternate suppliers; andOther Key Information53Table of Contents▪increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices, or supplier conduct that does not meet such standards, which can cause our compliance costs to increase or result in publicity that negatively affects our reputation.These and other supply chain issues can increase our costs, disrupt or reduce our production, delay our product shipments, prevent us from meeting customer demand, and damage our customer relationships. They may keep us from successfully implementing our business strategy and can materially harm our business, competitive position, results of operation, and financial condition. From time to time, our customers experience disruptions or shortages in their own supply chains that constrain their demand for our products. During 2021, the semiconductor industry experienced widespread shortages of substrates and other components and available foundry manufacturing capacity, and we anticipate that such shortages will continue in 2022. These shortages have limited our ability to supply customer demand in certain of our businesses, such as for our PSG products, and have adversely affected customer demand for our products, including in our CCG and DCG businesses, as some customers have been unable to procure sufficient quantities of third-party components used together with our products to produce finished systems. It is difficult to predict the future impact of these ongoing shortages.To obtain future supply of certain materials and components, particularly substrates, and third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, we have increasingly entered into arrangements with some of our suppliers that involve long-term purchase commitments and/or large prepayments. These arrangements could still prove inadequate to meet our requirements, or our suppliers may fail to deliver committed volumes on time or at all, or their financial condition may deteriorate. If future customer demand over the horizon of these arrangements falls below our expectations, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, unneeded capacity, and increased costs, and our prepayments may not be fully utilized, and in some cases may not be fully recoverable. We utilize third-party foundries and component suppliers to manufacture or supply certain components and products for areas such as networking, communications, graphics, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we expect to increase our use of third-party foundries for manufacturing, which will include modular tiles manufactured on advanced foundry process technologies for use in our core computing offerings. Delays in the development of foundries’ future manufacturing processes could delay the introduction of products or components we design for such processes, and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent us from meeting customer demand. We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, manufacturing yields, quality, product quantities, and costs for components and products that are manufactured by third parties. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply. However, for certain components, services, materials, and equipment, we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. For example, ASML is currently the sole supplier of EUV photolithography tools that we will be deploying in our Intel 4 and other future manufacturing process nodes. These tools are highly complex to develop and produce, and increasingly costly, and from time to time there are increases in lead times or delays in their development and availability, which could delay the development or ramp of our future process nodes. As a further example, a limited number of third-party foundries offer leading-edge manufacturing processes, and these providers are geographically concentrated in Asia. Supplier consolidation or business failures can also reduce the pool of qualified suppliers. Sole- or limited-source suppliers can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us and intensify the other risks described in this risk factor.Our disaggregated design strategy introduces additional production risks. Our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase.We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues. From time to time, we identify product defects, errata (deviations from published specifications), and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or gain through acquisitions, can also contain defects. Product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third-party products and software. We face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or applications, including transportation, autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses. Costs from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:▪writing off some or all of the value of inventory;▪recalling products that have been shipped;▪providing product replacements or modifications;▪providing consideration to customers, including reimbursement for certain costs they incur;▪defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and▪paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.Other Key Information54Table of ContentsThese costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and/or result in delay or loss of revenue. Mitigation techniques designed to address product issues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis—or at all—and do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues for all applications. We and third parties, such as hardware and software vendors, make prioritization decisions about which product issues to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation and result in costs. Product defects, errata, or other product issues and/or mitigation techniques can result in product failures, adverse performance and power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and other issues. Product issues can damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases or deployment, result in legal liability, or make our products less competitive, which could harm our business and financial results. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a product issue. In addition, our liability insurance coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products. We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products, as well as the operating systems and workloads that run on them and the components that interact with them. Components and IP we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard specifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. Our processors and other products are being used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category known as side-channel vulnerabilities, such as the variants referred to as \"Spectre\" and \"Meltdown.\" Additional categories and variants have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified. Publicity about these and other security vulnerabilities has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Security and manageability features in our products cannot make our products absolutely secure, and these features themselves are subject to vulnerabilities and attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become known. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a security vulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become aware of additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products, and address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.Mitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, are not always available on a timely basis—or at all—and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness, and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether, when, and how to develop and deploy mitigations. We and such third parties make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation. Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties.Security vulnerabilities and any limitations or adverse effects of mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For example, whether or not vulnerabilities involve attempted or successful exploits, they may result in our incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, providing product replacements or modifications, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. These effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are available, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation. We are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, and safety regulations. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations can result in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; suspension of production; alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. In addition, failure to comply by our suppliers of these materials can require us to suspend or alter our production processes.Other Key Information55Table of ContentsOur failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements, may impede our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future. Environmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Regulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements. For example, semiconductor manufacturing uses perfluorocarbons, which have historically made up a large portion of our direct greenhouse gas emissions. New or increased regulations limiting the use of such compounds, or other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to install additional abatement equipment, purchase carbon offsets, and/or alter our production processes. In addition, new or increased climate change regulation could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities. As we expand our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, the impacts of future regulation could be magnified. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations are subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.The COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has previously adversely affected significant portions of our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Authorities have imposed, and businesses and individuals have implemented, numerous measures to try to contain the virus or treat its impact, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place/stay-at-home and social distancing orders, shutdowns, and vaccine requirements. These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective suppliers and partners. We have experienced, and could in the future experience, reduced workforce availability at some of our sites, construction delays, and reduced capacity at some of our suppliers. We have significant manufacturing operations in the US, Ireland, Israel, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and each of these countries is taking measures in response to the pandemic. Restrictions on our manufacturing or support operations or workforce, similar limitations for our suppliers, and transportation restrictions or disruptions can limit our ability to meet customer demand and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our customers have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions in their operations and supply chains, which can result in delayed, reduced, or cancelled orders, or collection risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations. The pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices, including with respect to employee travel; employee work locations; cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events, and conferences; and social distancing measures. As a US federal government contractor, we are subject to a federal executive order requiring our US employees to be vaccinated unless they qualify for medical or religious exemptions. The order has been challenged in court and its ultimate status, and the impact on our business, is uncertain. However, this requirement or other future vaccine mandates could adversely affect our workforce retention and hiring. Similarly, this requirement would apply to our suppliers working at our US sites, and to the extent such suppliers refuse to comply or decline to work with us based on the requirement or other future vaccine mandates, our business may be adversely affected, including higher costs or delays for our construction projects. We may take further actions as required by government authorities or others, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, and partners. Work-from-home and other measures introduce additional operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, and have affected the way we conduct our product development, validation, and qualification, customer support, and other activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and illness and workforce disruptions could lead to unavailability of key personnel and harm our ability to perform critical functions.The pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, and has led to volatility in capital markets and credit markets. Risks related to adverse changes in global economic conditions are described in our risk factor titled \"Global or regional conditions can harm our financial results,\" and include the risk that demand for our products will be significantly harmed. Given the continued and substantial economic uncertainty and volatility created by the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the nature and extent of impacts on demand for our products. For example, the increased demand for notebook products as a result of work- and learn-from-home dynamics may not continue as the pandemic progresses.The degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and severity of the pandemic; the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact; other actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the virus and resulting economic disruption; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Additional impacts and risks may arise that we are not aware of or able to respond to effectively. We are similarly unable to predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our customers, suppliers, and other partners, but a material effect on these parties could also materially adversely affect us. The impact of COVID-19 can also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Risk Factors section and throughout this report.Other Key Information56Table of ContentsWe operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions.Global or regional conditions can harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the US accounted for 82% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021, with revenue from billings to China contributing 27% of our total revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control. Adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital and credit markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.We can be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur, including:▪geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and terrorist activity, including, for example, geopolitical tensions and conflict affecting Israel, where our Mobileye business headquarters and certain of our fabrication facilities are located;▪natural disasters, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other catastrophic events;▪inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;▪formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and changes in the ability to obtain export licenses, which could be changed without notice;▪government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;▪adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives, including more favorable incentives provided to competitors;▪differing employment practices and labor issues;▪ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;▪local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;▪continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the US and abroad; and▪fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, which can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, interest rate changes, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors.We are also subject to risks related to the cessation of US dollar LIBOR. Certain of our derivatives and floating-rate investments reference US dollar LIBOR, and a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on US dollar LIBOR. No new US dollar LIBOR-based activity should be conducted after 2021, and US dollar LIBOR will be unavailable for use in our existing contracts and financial instruments beyond June 30, 2023. While reasonable alternatives to LIBOR have been introduced into markets, our transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates could result in an increase in our interest expense and/or a reduction in our interest income.We are subject to risks related to trade policies and regulations. Trade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets. In particular, trade tensions between the US and China have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to some of our products, and have affected customer ordering patterns. The US has imposed restrictions on the export of US-regulated products and technology to certain Chinese technology companies, including certain of our customers. These restrictions have reduced our sales, and continuing or future restrictions could adversely affect our financial performance, result in reputational harm to us, or lead such companies to develop or adopt technologies that compete with our products. It is difficult to predict what further trade-related actions governments may take, which may include trade restrictions and additional or increased tariffs and export controls imposed on short notice, and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to or mitigate such actions. Other Key Information57Table of ContentsTrade disputes and protectionist measures, or continued uncertainty about such matters, could result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us. Sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, and decoupling of global trade networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.Laws and regulations can have a negative impact on our business. We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy and localization requirements; competition; advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. For example, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G or autonomous driving technology and MaaS may limit global adoption, impede our strategy, or negatively impact our long-term expectations for our investments in these areas. Expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and services, particularly in cloud, Internet of Things, and AI applications, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads.Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.We are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in US dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the US where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates can harm our results of operations and financial condition. Catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations and business, and those of our customers and suppliers, can be disrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic); cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, telecommunications, or IT systems providers; manufacturing equipment failures; or other catastrophic events. For example, we have at times experienced disruptions in our manufacturing processes as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, and disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, including due to cybersecurity incidents affecting our suppliers. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change can result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities, including facilities located in water-sensitive regions such as Arizona and Israel. In addition, to the extent we are unable to successfully manage and conserve water resources, our reputation could be harmed. In recent years, the west coast of the US has experienced significant wildfires, including in Oregon, where we have major manufacturing facilities. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the technology industry in particular are unclear, but could be severe. Catastrophic events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from such disruptions. Furthermore, even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly, if our customers or suppliers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, we may experience reduced or cancelled orders or disruptions to our supply chain that may adversely affect our results of operations.We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.Other Key Information58Table of ContentsDamage to our reputation can damage our business. Our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers, employees, governments, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Our failure to address, or the appearance of our failure to address, issues that give rise to reputational risk, including those described throughout this Risk Factors section, could significantly harm our reputation and our brands. Our reputation can be impacted by catastrophic events (including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic); incidents involving unethical behavior or misconduct; product quality, security, or safety issues; allegations of legal noncompliance; internal control failures; corporate governance issues; data breaches; workplace safety incidents; environmental incidents; our response to climate change, including our greenhouse gas emission levels; the use of our products for illegal or objectionable applications, including AI and machine learning applications that present ethical, regulatory, or other issues; marketing practices; media statements; the conduct of our suppliers or representatives; and other issues, incidents, or statements that, whether actual or perceived, result in adverse publicity. To the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address corporate crises, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brands and could lead to increases in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions. Damage to our reputation could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business and operating environment. It could reduce investor confidence in us, adversely affecting our stock price. It may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employees. Moreover, repairing our reputation and brands may be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive.We are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks.We face risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet, or to introduce malicious software, to our IT systems. Individuals or organizations, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored organizations, insider threats including employees and third-party service providers, or intruders into our physical facilities, at times attempt to gain unauthorized access and/or corrupt the processes used to design and manufacture our hardware products and our associated software and services. Due to the widespread use of our products, we are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, compromise, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our suppliers, customers, partners, or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, suppliers, and customers; interrupt our systems and services or those of our suppliers, customers, or others; or demand ransom to return control of such systems and services. Such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication, and if successful, expose us and the affected parties to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations, including our manufacturing operations. Our IT infrastructure also includes products and services provided by third parties, and these providers can experience breaches of their systems and products, or provide inadequate updates or support, which can impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or confidential information.From time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure, as well as those of third parties who provide products and services to us. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, our Habana Labs subsidiary’s network was breached, resulting in unauthorized third-party access of certain confidential information, in connection with a suspected unsuccessful ransomware attack. The breach was confined to our subsidiary's network and has not had a material impact on Habana Labs’ business. We are also subject to risks associated with attacks involving our supply chain, such as the compromise of IT infrastructure management software provided by SolarWinds Corporation, reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. During 2021, we have observed an increase in ransomware attacks in our supply chain. In December 2021, a vulnerability named “Log4Shell” was reported for the widely used Java logging library, Apache Log4j 2. We have reviewed the use of this library within our software product portfolio and in our IT environment and have taken steps to mitigate the vulnerability. To date, cybersecurity incidents have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations, but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, writing down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain the business relationship, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties, as well as reputational harm. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work and remote access to our systems has increased significantly, which also increases our cybersecurity attack surface. We have also seen an increase in cyberattack volume, frequency, and sophistication driven by the global enablement of remote workforces. We seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes or updates to our internal processes and tools and changes or updates to our products and services; however, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. In some instances, we, our suppliers, our customers, and the users of our products and services can be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. There is increasing regulation regarding responses to cybersecurity incidents, including reporting to regulators, which could subject us to additional liability and reputational harm.Other Key Information59Table of ContentsTheft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business, including data stored with vendors or other third parties, could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. We anticipate that our collection of such personal data will increase as we enter into the MaaS market in our Mobileye business, and it may increase as we enter into other new or adjacent businesses. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant, and noncompliance could expose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and even criminal sanctions. Even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data-protection laws and regulations could result in audits, regulatory inquiries, or proceedings against us by governmental entities or other third parties.We are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We cannot always protect our IP or enforce our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP and IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. We are not always able to obtain protection for our IP or enforce or protect our IP rights. Enforcement is costly and time-consuming and can divert management attention. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. From time to time, governments adopt regulations—and governments or courts render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and business. In some cases, our IP rights can offer inadequate protection for our innovations. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced. This risk is heightened as competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees.Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to some of our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.Third parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business. We face claims based on IP rights from individuals, companies, non-practicing entities, academic and research institutions, and other parties, including claims from those who have aggregated patents acquired from multiple sources to form a new, larger portfolio to assert claims against us and other companies. Additionally, large patent portfolio owners sometimes divest portions of their portfolios to more than one individual or company, increasing the number of parties who own IP rights previously all held by a single party. We have seen an increase in patent assertions and lawsuits initiated by well-funded non-practicing entities, including entities funded by investment firms and other third parties. In some instances, these entities have filed multi-jurisdiction litigation seeking large monetary damages and/or injunctions against us. These lawsuits can increase our cost of doing business and could disrupt our operations if they succeed in blocking the trade of our products. For example, in the multi-jurisdiction litigation brought against us by VLSI, a jury in one of the pending US federal court cases returned a verdict in February 2021 awarding approximately $2.2 billion in damages to VLSI, as discussed in Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements. The patent litigation environment has also become more challenging due to the emergence of venues adopting procedural and substantive rules that make them more favorable for patent asserters, including the availability of injunctive relief for non-practicing entities, and the US Patent and Trademark Office’s reduction of inter partes patent review  under the America Invents Act. As a result, we believe we are facing a more hostile IP litigation environment.We are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products, technologies, or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets, confidential information, or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers' businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.As a result of IP rights claims, we could:▪pay monetary damages, payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, royalties, fines, or penalties;▪stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;    Other Key Information60Table of Contents▪need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or▪enter into settlement or license agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and may be costly.These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of our products are designed to include third-party technology or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. In addition, from time to time, third parties notify us that they believe we are using their IP. There is no assurance that necessary licenses to such third-party IP can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that our existing licenses to third-party IP will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party technology, or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. To the extent our products include software that contains or is derived from open-source software, we may be required to make the software's source code publicly available and/or license the software under open-source licensing terms.We are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory matters. From time to time, we face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, commercial, IP, labor and employment, compliance, and other issues on a global basis. As described in \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur, including monetary damages, fines, penalties, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, harmful to our reputation, and distracting to management.We must attract, retain, and motivate key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business. The competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is increasingly intense. Competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees, and the increased availability of work-from-home arrangements, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has both intensified and expanded competition. In addition, changes in immigration policies may further limit the pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. We have intensified our efforts to recruit and retain talent. These efforts have increased our expenses, and they may not be successful in attracting, retaining, and motivating the workforce necessary to deliver on our strategy. Changes in employment-related laws applicable to our workforce practices may also result in increased expenses and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. Sustained declines in our stock price, or lower stock price performance relative to competitors, can reduce the retention value of our share-based awards. Our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. To the extent our compensation programs and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees can be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Changes in our management team can also disrupt our business. For example, we appointed a new CEO effective in February 2021 and a new CFO in January 2022 and made several other changes to our senior leadership during the past year. The failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employees could adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent we do not effectively hire, onboard, retain, and motivate key employees, our business can be harmed.We are subject to risks associated with our strategic transactions.Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and adversely impact our results of operations. Strategic transactions are an important component of our financial capital allocation strategy. We routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:▪our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;▪failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and failure of its anticipated benefits to materialize;▪disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management's attention;▪failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, if at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals at all or without materially burdensome conditions, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or other unforeseen factors;▪our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, and restructuring charges;▪our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses;▪our inability to retain key personnel of acquired businesses or our difficulty in integrating employees, business systems, and technology;Other Key Information61Table of Contents▪controls, processes, and procedures of acquired businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to identify compliance issues or liabilities;▪our failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets; and▪the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt.Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions. Moreover, our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we at times need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives. Where an existing investment does not strategically align to our key priorities, we routinely evaluate opportunities for possible divestitures and other options. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of divestitures due to risks that include unfavorable prices and terms; changes in market conditions or geopolitical conditions affecting the regions or industries in which we or counterparties operate; failure to receive regulatory or governmental approvals; limitations or restrictions due to regulatory or governmental approvals, litigation, contractual terms, or other conditions; delays in closing; lack of support by third parties; actions by competitors; adverse effects on our business relationships, operating results, or business due to the announcement and pendency of such transactions; and continued financial obligations, unanticipated liabilities, or transition costs associated with such transactions. In some cases, we are not able to divest investments on acceptable terms or at all.We invest in public and private companies and do not always realize a return on our investments. We make investments in public and private companies to further our strategic and financial objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return in a timely fashion, if at all. Our ability to realize a return on our investment in a private company, if any, is typically dependent on the company participating in a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, which at times includes bankruptcy, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment.There are risks associated with our previously-announced proposed IPO of Mobileye. We announced that we intend to take Mobileye public in the US via an IPO of newly issued Mobileye stock, and that we expect to retain majority ownership of Mobileye following the completion of the IPO. The IPO may not be completed in our expected timeframe, or at all, due to factors that include adverse changes in economic or market conditions or in our business; delays in regulatory, stock exchange, or other approvals; loss of Mobileye key employees, and changes in our business strategy. If we do not complete the IPO, our ability to retain and attract Mobileye employees could be adversely affected, and we will have incurred expenses that we will be unable to recover, and for which we will not receive any benefit. If completed, the IPO may not produce any increase for our stockholders in the market value of their holdings in our company. In addition, the market price of our common stock could be more volatile after the IPO.We are subject to sales-related risks. We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs and ODMs. We depend on many distributors to help us create end-customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. At times, we rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products is limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products is not always easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties sell products that compete with our products, and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. From time to time, they face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.From time to time, our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized \"gray market.\" Gray market products can distort demand and pricing dynamics in our distribution channel and certain geographies, which at times adversely affects our revenue opportunities. Gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more challenging. Gray market products also sometimes include parts that have been altered or damaged, and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to be substandard.We receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Collectively, our three largest customers accounted for 43% of our net revenue in 2021 and 39% of our net revenue in 2020. We expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future.Other Key Information62Table of ContentsIndustry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increased the significance and purchasing power of certain customers, particularly cloud service providers, in some of our data center-focused businesses. The cloud and cloud applications represent a new and increasingly demanding computing environment. The further consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and applications; product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product security and security features. Our competitive position can be eroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors. We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, including in serving cloud service provider customers, and the competitive environment adversely affected our results in DCG in 2021. Some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including designs customized for their specific computing workloads. In addition, cloud services can be marketed to end users based on service levels or features rather than hardware specifications, or they can abstract hardware under layers of software, which can make it more difficult to differentiate our products to customers and end users. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely affected, and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise and government market segment customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud customer specifications, order changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs. The loss of a key customer, a substantial reduction in sales to them, or changes in the timing of their orders can lead to a reduction in our revenue, increase the volatility of our results, and harm our results of operations and financial condition. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.We face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from US federal, state, local, and foreign government entities associated with grants, incentives, and sales of our products and services. Government demand and payment are often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including, with respect to US government contracts, congressional approval of appropriations. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, certain agreements with the US government are subject to special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, security, and/or employees, and failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or debarment from future business with the US government.Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.A number of factors can increase our effective tax rate, which could reduce our net income, including:    ▪changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;▪the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;▪changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;▪adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;▪increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;▪changes in available tax credits;▪changes in our ability to secure new, or renew existing, tax holidays and incentives;▪changes in US federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the US to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-US income and expenses and changes resulting from the adoption by countries of OECD recommendations or other legislative actions;▪changes in accounting standards; and▪our decision to repatriate non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.We have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases. We are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program. The amount, timing, and execution of our repurchases fluctuate based on factors that include prioritizing cash for other purposes, such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments. Our stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. We expect our future stock repurchases to be significantly below our levels from the last few years.

On March 2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one such sanction. From time to time, our local subsidiary is required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and file documents in order to conduct business within the Russian Federation. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B issued by the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB. We plan to continue these activities as required to conduct business in the Russian Federation to the extent permitted by applicable law.On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such activities.

In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 26, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Auditor's Reports69Table of ContentsInventory ValuationDescription of the MatterThe Company's net inventory totaled $10.8 billion as of December 25, 2021, representing 6.4% of total assets. As explained in \"Note 2: Accounting Policies\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company computes inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and applies judgment in determining saleability of products and the valuation of inventories. The Company assesses inventory at each reporting date in order to assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the products have achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers; the determination of normal capacity levels in its manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory; whether the product is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of saleable quality. Auditing management's assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the determination of lower of cost or net realizable value and excess and obsolete inventory reserves is judgmental and considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as customer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand. Additionally, for certain new product launches there is limited historical data with which to evaluate forecasts.How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over the costing of inventory, the determination of whether inventory is of saleable quality, the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value reserves including related estimated costs and selling prices, and the determination of demand forecasts and related application against on hand inventory.Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions (e.g., estimated product costs and selling prices, and product demand forecasts) and the underlying data used in management's inventory valuation assessment. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends. We assessed whether there were any potential sources of contrary information, including historical forecast accuracy or history of significant revisions to previously recorded inventory valuation adjustments, and performed sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in inventory valuation that would result from changes in the assumptions. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP      We have served as the Company's auditor since 1968.San Jose, CaliforniaJanuary 26, 2022 Auditor's Reports70Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel CorporationOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited Intel Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intel Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and our report dated January 26, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP                          San Jose, CaliforniaJanuary 26, 2022Auditor's Reports71Table of ContentsConsolidated Statements of

year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 were 52-week fiscal years; 2022 is a 53-week fiscal year. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Intel and our subsidiaries. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates.Note 2 : Accounting PoliciesRevenue RecognitionWe recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or services to customers. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sales. In accordance with contract terms, revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed upon shipping terms. We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Variable consideration is estimated and reflected as an adjustment to the transaction price. We determine variable consideration, which consists primarily of various sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. Sales rebates earned by customers are offset against their receivable balances. Rebates earned by customers when they do not have outstanding receivable balances are recorded within other accrued liabilities.We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs for marketing activities for some of our products. We generally record the payment as a reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned, unless the payment is for a distinct service, which we record as expense when the marketing activities occur.InventoriesWe compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities and associated costs change in nature from R&D to cost of sales, and when cost of sales can be capitalized as inventory. For a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as PRQ. We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. A single PRQ has previously valued inventory up to $870 million in the quarter the PRQ milestone was achieved. Prior to PRQ, costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost of sales in the period incurred.The valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities. We apply our historical loadings compared to our total available capacity in a statistical model to determine our normal capacity level. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges are insignificant in the years presented. Charges in years prior to those presented have ranged up to $1.1 billion taken in connection with the 2009 economic recession.Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle, variations in market pricing, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. Lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserves fluctuate as we ramp new process technologies, with costs improving over time due to scale and improved yields. Additionally, inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical changes in market conditions and the associated pricing environment. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements77Table of ContentsThe valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We use the demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we write off amounts considered to be excess inventory. Property, Plant and EquipmentWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment.We evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant and equipment, considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives.Assets are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. Fair ValueWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: ▪Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.▪Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use LIBOR-based yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.▪Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.Debt InvestmentsWe consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can include investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements.Marketable debt investments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements78Table of ContentsMarketable debt investments are considered available-for-sale investments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criteria for designation as trading assets are not met. Available-for-sale debt investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalents. Available-for-sale debt investments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Available-for-sale debt investments with remaining maturities beyond one year are classified as other long-term investments. Available-for-sale debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level, and record the interest income and realized gains or losses on the sale of these investments in interest and other, net.Our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews. For investments in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists by considering information about the collectability of the instrument, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. We recognize an allowance for credit losses, up to the amount of the unrealized loss when appropriate, and write down the amortized cost basis of the investment if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in interest and other, net, and unrealized losses not related to credit losses are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).Equity InvestmentsWe regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows: ▪Marketable equity securities are equity securities with RDFV that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement. ▪Non-marketable equity securities are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes.▪Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss. Our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investments is recognized on a one-quarter lag.Realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted for qualifying observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates. Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investee's fair value. Qualitative factors considered include the investee's financial condition and business outlook, industry and sector performance, market for technology, operational and financing cash flow activities, and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches, which require judgment and the use of estimates, including discount rates, investee revenue and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. ▪Non-marketable equity securities are tested for impairment using a qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and long-lived assets. Upon determining that an impairment may exist, the security's fair value is calculated and compared to its carrying value and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.▪Equity method investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews using the other-than-temporary impairment model, which considers the severity and duration of a decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery. Impairments of equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements79Table of ContentsDerivative Financial InstrumentsOur primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. For presentation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments, including related collateral amounts, are presented at fair value on a gross basis and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities.Cash flow hedges use foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards and currency interest rate swaps, to hedge exposures for variability in the US-dollar equivalent of non-US-dollar-denominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital purchases spending.The after-tax gains or losses from the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the impact of the hedge transaction. For foreign currency contracts hedging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, and are recognized in earnings in the same income statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the cash flow hedge transactions become improbable, the corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be immediately reclassified to interest and other, net. These derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item.Fair value hedges use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the offsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other, net. These derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from financing activities.Non-designated hedges use foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, non-US-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets, and non-US-dollar-denominated loans receivable recognized at fair value. We also use interest rate contracts to hedge interest rate risk related to our US-dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt investments classified as trading assets. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded through earnings in the line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income to which the derivatives most closely relate, primarily in interest and other, net. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives. Loans ReceivableWe elect the fair value option when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at the inception of the loan with a related derivative instrument. When the fair value option is not elected, the loans are carried at amortized cost. We measure interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method, which is based on the effective yield of the loans rather than the stated coupon rate. We classify our loans within other current and long-term assets. Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, loans receivable, reverse repurchase agreements, and trade receivables. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty's relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy, substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December 25, 2021, our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding money market funds invested in US treasury and US agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed $2.6 billion. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our derivative counterparties and obtain and secure collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions when we deem it appropriate. Cash collateral exchanged under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. For reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability unless the collateral is repledged. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements80Table of ContentsA substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to OEMs and ODMs. We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. We believe the net accounts receivable balances from our three largest customers (42% as of December 25, 2021) do not represent a significant credit risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments in determining the fair value of the following:▪inventory; property, plant and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; and contingent consideration, each as may be applicable; ▪intangible assets, including the valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, and our assumed market segment share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;▪deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date; and▪goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies. We allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination.GoodwillWe perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. The reporting unit's carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. Additionally, as part of this assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value.Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. Significant estimates include market segment growth rates, our assumed market segment share, estimated gross margins, operating expenses, and discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital.We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. In the current year, the fair value for all of our reporting units substantially exceeds their carrying value, and our annual qualitative assessment did not indicate that a more detailed quantitative analysis was necessary. Identified Intangible AssetsWe amortize acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life. Acquisition-related in-process R&D assets represent the fair value of incomplete R&D projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition; initially, these are classified as in-process R&D and are not subject to amortization. Once these R&D projects are completed, the asset balances are transferred from in-process R&D to acquisition-related developed technology and are subject to amortization from that point forward. The asset balances relating to projects that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to R&D.We perform a quarterly review of significant finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. These reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Employee Equity Incentive PlansWe use the straight-line amortization method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the service period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of RSUs, we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements81Table of ContentsFor the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.Income TaxesWe compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is affected by management's plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, such changes could also affect our future provision for taxes.We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income.We recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in US taxable income as a period cost. We have recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-US earnings or for outside basis differences in our subsidiaries, because we do not plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis differences. Remittances of non-US earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-US and US operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-US earnings, which could be subject to applicable non-US income and withholding taxes. LeasesLeases consist of real property and machinery and equipment. Our lease terms may include options to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and the non-lease components are accounted for separately and not included in our leased assets and corresponding liabilities. Payments on leases may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are based on output of the underlying leased assets.Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims, liabilities related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters.Note 3 : Operating SegmentsWe manage our business through the following operating segments:▪CCG▪DCG▪IOTG▪Mobileye▪NSG▪PSGWe derive a substantial majority of our revenue from platform products, which are our principal products and considered as one class of product. We offer platform products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, based on Intel architecture. Platform products are used in various form factors across our CCG, DCG, and IOTG operating segments. Our non-platform, or adjacent, products can be combined with platform products to form comprehensive platform solutions to meet customer needs. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements82Table of ContentsCCG and DCG are our reportable operating segments. IOTG, Mobileye, NSG, and PSG do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. Our Internet of Things portfolio, presented as Internet of Things, is comprised of the IOTG and Mobileye operating segments. For 2021, the results of our Intel Optane memory business are included in our DCG operating segment, and our NSG segment is comprised of our NAND memory business to align to the pending divestiture of our NAND memory business. Refer to \"Note 10 : Acquisitions and Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the divestiture. We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments.We have an \"all other\" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:▪results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented; ▪historical results of operations from divested businesses; ▪results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business; ▪amounts included within restructuring and other charges; ▪a portion of employee benefits, compensation, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and ▪acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements83Table of ContentsNet revenue and operating income (loss) for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Net revenue:Client Computing GroupPlatform$37,376 $35,642 $32,681 Adjacent3,135 4,415 4,465 40,511 40,057 37,146 Data Center GroupPlatform22,703 23,056 21,441 Adjacent3,118 3,047 2,040 25,821 26,103 23,481 Internet of Things IOTG3,998 3,007 3,821 Mobileye1,386 967 879 5,384 3,974 4,700 Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group4,306 5,358 4,362 Programmable Solutions Group1,934 1,853 1,987 All other1,068 522 289 Total net revenue$79,024 $77,867 $71,965 Operating income (loss):Client Computing Group$14,672 $15,129 $15,202 Data Center Group6,997 10,571 10,227 Internet of ThingsIOTG1,045 497 1,097 Mobileye460 241 245 1,505 738 1,342 Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group1,369 361 (1,176)Programmable Solutions Group297 260 318 All other(5,384)(3,381)(3,878)Total operating income$19,456 $23,678 $22,035 Disaggregated net revenue for each period was as follows:Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Platform revenueCCG notebook platform$25,475 $24,903 $20,779 CCG desktop platform11,835 10,692 11,822 CCG other platform166 47 80 DCG platform22,703 23,056 21,441 IOTG platform3,658 2,705 3,440 63,737 61,403 57,562 Adjacent revenue215,287 16,464 14,403 Total revenue$79,024 $77,867 $71,965 1  Includes our tablet and service provider revenue.2  Includes all of our non-platform products for CCG, DCG, and IOTG, such as modem, Ethernet, and silicon photonics, as well as Mobileye, NSG, and PSG products. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements84Table of ContentsIn 2021, our three largest customers accounted for 43% of our net revenue (39% in 2020 and 41% in 2019), with Dell Inc. accounting for 21% (17% in 2020 and 17% in 2019), Lenovo Group Limited accounting for 12% (12% in 2020 and 13% in 2019), and HP Inc. accounting for 10% (10% in 2020 and 11% in 2019). These three customers accounted for 42% of our accounts receivable as of December 25, 2021 (43% as of December 26, 2020).

Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the 2006 ESPP. In January 2020, we fully redeemed the remaining principal of our 2009 Debentures. We included our 2009 Debentures in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of common stock in 2019 by applying the treasury stock method because the average market price was above the conversion price.Securities that would have been anti-dilutive are insignificant and are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in all periods presented.Note 5 : Contract LiabilitiesContract liabilities consist of prepayments received on long-term prepaid customer supply agreements toward future product delivery and other revenue deferrals from regular ongoing business activity. Contract liabilities were $498 million as of December 25, 2021 ($1.9 billion as of December 26, 2020).The following table shows the changes in contract liability balances relating to long-term prepaid customer supply agreements during 2021:(In Millions)Prepaid customer supply agreements balance as of December 26, 2020$1,625 Concession payment(950)Prepaids utilized (633)Prepaid customer supply agreements balance as of December 25, 2021$42 During the first quarter of 2021, we settled an agreement with our largest prepaid customer, whose prepayment balance made up $1.6 billion of our contract liability balance as of December 26, 2020.

As a result of the restructuring, we established deferred tax assets and released the valuation allowances of certain foreign deferred tax assets. The majority of these deferred tax assets established in 2021 fully offset the deferred tax liabilities recognized in 2020 driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to undistributed earnings in China, as a result of the planned divestiture of our NAND memory business.Our effective tax rate increased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to undistributed earnings in China, as a result of the planned divestiture of our NAND memory business. It also increased due to the reduction in our foreign derived intangible income benefit in 2020.We derive the effective tax rate benefit attributed to non-US income taxed at different rates primarily from our operations in Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, and Malaysia. The statutory tax rates in these jurisdictions range from 12.5% to 24.0%. We are subject to reduced tax rates in Israel and Malaysia as long as we conduct certain eligible activities and make certain capital investments. We have conditional reduced tax rates that expire at various dates through 2056 and we expect to apply for renewals upon expiration. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements88Table of ContentsDeferred and Current Income TaxesDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes.

Most of the non-US net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining non-US and US federal net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2040. A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards in the US relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year. The federal and non-US net operating loss carryforwards include $357 million and $860 million, respectively, that is not likely to be recovered and has been reduced by a valuation allowance.At December 25, 2021, we have undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $18.9 billion that we have indefinitely invested, and on which we have not recognized deferred taxes.

Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain US federal and non-US tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 25, 2021 could decrease by as much as $327 million in the next 12 months. We file federal, state, and non-US tax returns. Excluding pre-acquisition Altera tax years, we are no longer subject to US federal and non-US tax examinations for years prior to 2013. For US state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2014.Note 9 : InvestmentsDebt InvestmentsTrading AssetsFor trading assets still held at the reporting date, we recorded net losses of $606 million in 2021 (net gains of $694 million in 2020 and net gains of $26 million in 2019). Net gains on the related derivatives were $609 million in 2021 (net losses of $667 million in 2020 and net gains of $22 million in 2019).Available-for-Sale Debt InvestmentsAvailable-for-sale investments include corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bonds and US agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, substantially all time deposits were issued by institutions outside the US. The adjusted cost of our available-for-sale investments was $5.0 billion as of December 25, 2021 ($7.8 billion as of December 26, 2020). The adjusted cost of our available-for-sale investments approximated the fair value for these periods.The fair values of available-for-sale debt investments by contractual maturity as of December 25, 2021 were as follows:(In Millions)Fair ValueDue in 1 year or less$2,931 Due in 1–2 years559 Due in 2–5 years281 Due after 5 years— Instruments not due at a single maturity date1,216 Total$4,987  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements90Table of ContentsEquity Investments(In Millions)Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Marketable equity securities$2,171 $1,830 Non-marketable equity securities4,111 3,304 Equity method investments16 18 Total$6,298 $5,152 The components of gains (losses) on equity investments, net for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable equity securities$(130)$(133)$277 Observable price adjustments on non-marketable equity securities750 176 293 Impairment charges(154)(303)(122)Sale of equity investments and other 12,263 2,164 1,091 Total gains (losses) on equity investments, net$2,729 $1,904 $1,539 1    Sale of equity investments and other includes initial fair value adjustments recorded upon a security becoming marketable, realized gains (losses) on sales of non-marketable equity investments, and our share of equity method investee gains (losses) and distributions.In 2021, we recognized impairments of $154 million on non-marketable equity securities ($290 million in 2020 and $122 million in 2019).

During 2021, we recognized McAfee dividends of $1.3 billion, which includes a special dividend of $1.1 billion paid in connection with the sale of McAfee's Enterprise Business to Symphony Technology Group and $228 million related to the partial sale of our investment in McAfee. We recognized McAfee dividends of $126 million in 2020  and $632 million in 2019.In November 2021, McAfee announced an agreement to be acquired by an investor group, which is subject to closing conditions.Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd.We account for our interest in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. (Unisoc) as a non-marketable equity security. In the first quarter of 2021, we recognized $471 million in observable price adjustments in our investment in Unisoc and as of December 25, 2021, the net book value of the investment was $1.1 billion ($658 million as of December 26, 2020).Note 10 : Acquisitions and DivestituresAcquisitionsWe completed four acquisitions in 2021 and six acquisitions in 2020, all of which qualified as business combinations. The consideration for the acquisitions in 2021 and 2020 primarily consisted of cash and was allocated to goodwill and identified intangible assets. For information on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments, see \"Note 11: Goodwill,\" and for information on the classification of intangible assets, see \"Note 12: Identified Intangible Assets.\" Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements91Table of ContentsMoovitOn May 4, 2020, we acquired Moovit, a MaaS solutions company, for total consideration of $915 million. The fair values of the assets acquired relate to goodwill of $638 million and intangible assets of $331 million. The goodwill arising from the acquisition is attributed to the expected synergies and other benefits that will be generated from the combination of Intel and Moovit. Substantially all of the goodwill will not be deductible for local tax purposes. The acquisition-related intangible assets are primarily related to Moovit's monthly active user base and application platform. The goodwill and operating results of Moovit are included in our Mobileye operating segment.DivestituresNAND Memory BusinessIn October 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix Inc. (SK hynix) to divest our NAND memory business for $9.0 billion in cash. The NAND memory business includes our NAND memory fabrication facility in Dalian, China and certain related equipment and tangible assets (the Fab Assets), our NAND SSD business (the NAND SSD Business), and our NAND memory technology and manufacturing business (the NAND OpCo Business). The transaction will be completed in two closings. The first closing was completed on December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. At first closing, SK hynix paid $7.0 billion of consideration, with the remaining $2.0 billion to be received at the second closing of the transaction, expected to be no earlier than March 2025. In connection with the first closing, we expect to recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.0 billion within interest and other, net, and tax expense of approximately $450 million. Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, approximately $600 million of the initial closing consideration will be deferred and recognized between first and second closing within interest and other, net.At the first closing, we sold to SK hynix the Fab Assets and the NAND SSD Business and transferred certain employees, IP, and other assets related to the NAND OpCo Business to separately created wholly owned subsidiaries of Intel. The equity interest of the NAND OpCo Business will transfer to SK hynix at the second closing. In connection with the first closing, we and certain affiliates of SK hynix also entered into a NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, pursuant to which we will manufacture and sell to SK hynix NAND memory wafers to be manufactured using the Fab Assets in Dalian, China until the second closing. We have concluded based on the terms of the transaction agreements that the subsidiaries will be variable interest entities for which we are not the primary beneficiary, because the governance structure of these entities does not allow us to direct the activities that would most significantly impact their economic performance. In line with this conclusion, we will fully deconsolidate our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022, and will record a receivable for the second closing proceeds of $1.9 billion. The carrying amounts of the major classes of NAND assets held for sale included the following:(In Millions)Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Inventories$953 $962 Property, plant and equipment, net5,989 4,363 Total assets$6,942 $5,325 We ceased recording depreciation on property, plant and equipment as of the date the assets triggered held for sale accounting. The agreement provided for continued capital purchases through first closing and we invested $1.6 billion in 2021, which is classified as assets held for sale at period end and sold at first closing. Home Gateway Platform DivisionOn July 31, 2020, we completed the divestiture of the majority of Home Gateway Platform, a division of CCG, for proceeds of $150 million. The divestiture included the transfer of certain employees, equipment, and an ongoing supply agreement for future units.Smartphone Modem BusinessOn December 2, 2019, we completed the divestiture of the majority of our smartphone modem business, including certain employees, IP, equipment, and leases. Net assets sold were $267 million. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $690 million on the divestiture.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements92Table of ContentsNote 11 : Goodwill(In Millions)Dec 26, 2020AcquisitionsOtherDec 25, 2021Client Computing Group$4,360 $73 $— $4,433 Data Center Group7,232 123 — 7,355 Internet of Things Group1,591 — — 1,591 Mobileye10,928 — — 10,928 Programmable Solutions Group2,622 — 34 2,656 All other238 — (238)— Total$26,971 $196 $(204)$26,963 (In Millions)Dec 28, 2019AcquisitionsOtherDec 26, 2020Client Computing Group$4,333 $27 $— $4,360 Data Center Group7,182 50 — 7,232 Internet of Things Group 1,579 12— 1,591Mobileye10,290 638— 10,928Programmable Solutions Group 2,654 2(34)2,622All other238 — — 238Total$26,276 $729 $(34)$26,971 During the second quarter of 2021, we recognized a goodwill impairment loss of $238 million related to two non-strategic businesses that we exited, recorded within our \"all other\" category.

Net proceeds from the offerings are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include refinancing outstanding debt, funding for working capital, and capital expenditures. During 2021, we repaid $500 million of our 1.70% senior notes that matured in May 2021 and $2.0 billion of our 3.30% senior notes that matured in October 2021. In 2020, we issued a total of $10.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and repaid $1.0 billion of our 1.85% senior notes that matured in May 2020 and $1.8 billion of our 2.45% senior notes that matured in July 2020. We also repaid $700 million in floating-rate senior notes that matured in May 2020. Our floating-rate senior note pays interest quarterly and our fixed-rate senior notes pay interest semiannually. We may redeem the fixed-rate notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified redemption prices and subject to certain restrictions. The obligations under the notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.Revolving Credit FacilityIn 2021, we entered into a $5.0 billion variable-rate revolving credit facility that, if drawn, is expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The revolving credit facility matures in March 2026 and had no borrowings outstanding as of December 25, 2021.Convertible DebenturesIn 2009, we issued the 2009 Debentures, which were convertible, subject to certain conditions, into shares of our common stock and paid a fixed rate of interest semiannually. In 2020, we paid $1.1 billion in cash to settle our remaining $372 million in principal, resulting in a loss of $109 million in interest and other, net and $750 million as a reduction in stockholders' equity related to the conversion feature.

If an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized on our non-marketable equity securities during the period, we classify these assets as Level 3. We classify non-marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity method investments as Level 3. Impairments recognized on these investments held as of December 25, 2021 were $138 million ($266 million on investments held as of December 26, 2020 and $113 million on investments held as of December 28, 2019).Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisFinancial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments that have not been remeasured or impaired in the current period, grants receivable, and issued debt.

The aggregate carrying value of grants receivable as of December 25, 2021 was $317 million (the aggregate carrying value of grants receivable as of December 26, 2020 was $139 million).We classify the fair value of issued debt (excluding commercial paper and drafts payable) as Level 2.

The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. For the benefit of eligible US employees, we also provide an unfunded non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees. We expensed $444 million in 2021 and $398 million in 2020 for matching contributions based on the amount of employee contributions under the US qualified defined contribution and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Prior to 2020, the contributions were discretionary and we expensed $379 million in 2019.US Retiree Medical PlanUpon retirement, we provide certain benefits to eligible US employees who were hired prior to 2014 under the US Retiree Medical Plan. The benefits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase eligible coverage in a medical plan.As of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, the projected benefit obligation was $682 million and $741 million, which used the discount rate of 2.8% and 2.4%. The December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 corresponding fair value of plan assets was $669 million and $600 million.The investment strategy for US Retiree Medical Plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The assets are invested in tax-aware global equity and fixed-income long credit portfolios. Both portfolios are actively managed by external managers. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries. The tax-aware fixed-income long credit portfolio is composed of domestic securities. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 65% equity and 35% fixed income investments. As of December 25, 2021, the majority of the US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. The remaining US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in fixed income investments and were measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs.The estimated benefit payments for this plan over the next 10 years are as follows: (In Millions)202220232024202520262027-2031Postretirement Medical Benefits$37 $38 $39 $41 $42 $219 Pension Benefit PlansWe provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain countries, most significantly Ireland, the US, Israel, and Germany. The majority of the plans' benefits have been frozen. Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets for Pension Benefit PlansThe vested benefit obligation for a defined-benefit pension plan is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is currently entitled based on the employee's expected date of separation or retirement. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements101Table of Contents (In Millions)Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Changes in projected benefit obligation:Beginning projected benefit obligation$4,929 $4,284 Service cost54 49 Interest cost91 97 Actuarial (gain) loss(284)373 Currency exchange rate changes(150)261 Plan settlements(126)(79)Other(58)(56)Ending projected benefit obligation14,456 4,929 Changes in fair value of plan assets:Beginning fair value of plan assets2,878 2,654 Actual return on plan assets145 203 Currency exchange rate changes(63)113Plan settlements(126)(79)Other(17)(13)Ending fair value of plan assets22,817 2,878 Net unfunded status$1,639 $2,051 Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance SheetsOther long-term liabilities$1,639 $2,051 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (income), before tax3$1,445 $1,911 Accumulated benefit obligation4$4,086 $4,429 1    The projected benefit obligation was approximately 30% in the US and 70% outside of the US as of December 25, 2021 and approximately 35% in the US and 65% outside of the US as of December 26, 2020.2    The fair value of plan assets was approximately 50% in the US and 50% outside of the US as of December 25, 2021 and approximately 55% in the US and 45% outside of the US as of December 26, 2020.3    The accumulated other comprehensive loss (income), before tax, was approximately 30% in the US and 70% outside of the US as of December 25, 2021 and approximately 35% in the US and 65% outside of the US as of December 26, 2020. 4    All plans had accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets for all periods presented. Changes in actuarial gains and losses in the projected benefit obligation are generally driven by discount rate movement. We use the corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line basis.Assumptions for Pension Benefit PlansDec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligationsDiscount rate2.2 %1.9 %Rate of compensation increase3.2 %3.2 %202120202019Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine costsDiscount rate1.9 %2.3 %3.4 %Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets2.7 %3.3 %4.7 %Rate of compensation increase3.2 %3.2 %3.5 %We establish the discount rate for each pension plan by analyzing current market long-term bond rates and matching the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension liabilities. We establish the long-term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements102Table of ContentsFundingOur practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and regulations. Additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate. Funding for the US Retiree Medical Plan is discretionary under applicable laws and regulations; additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate.On a worldwide basis, our pension and retiree medical plans were 68% funded as of December 25, 2021. The US Pension Plan, which accounts for 28% of the worldwide pension and retiree medical benefit obligations, was 99% funded. Funded status is not indicative of our ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to fund retirement trusts. Required pension funding for US retirement plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, which sets required minimum contributions. Cumulative company funding to the US Pension Plan currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding requirements.Net Periodic Benefit CostThe net periodic benefit cost for pension and US retiree medical benefits was $162 million in 2021 ($164 million in 2020 and $135 million in 2019).

The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 90% fixed income and 10% equity investments. During 2021, the US Pension Plan assets were invested in collective investment trust funds, which are measured at net asset value. Non-US Plan AssetsThe investments of the non-US plans are managed by insurance companies, pension funds, or third-party trustees, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, either through index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and to help ensure that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as they come due. The target allocation of the non-US plan assets that we have control over was approximately 45% fixed income, 35% equity, and 20% hedge fund investments in 2021.The equity investments in the non-US plan assets are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the US, and emerging markets throughout the world.We have control over the investment strategy related to the majority of the assets measured at net asset value, which are invested in hedge funds, bond index funds, and equity index funds.Estimated Future Benefit Payments for Pension Benefit PlansEstimated benefit payments over the next 10 years are as follows:(In Millions)202220232024202520262027-2031Pension benefits$147 $144 $141 $142 $146 $765  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements103Table of ContentsNote 18 : Employee Equity Incentive PlansOur equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. Our plans include our 2006 Plan and our 2006 ESPP.Under the 2006 Plan, 866 million shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through June 2023. As of December 25, 2021, 128 million shares of common stock remained available for future grants.Under the 2006 Plan, we grant RSUs and stock options. We grant RSUs with a service condition as well as RSUs with a market condition, performance condition, and a service condition, which we call PSUs. PSUs are granted to a group of senior officers and employees. For PSUs granted in 2021, the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting will range from 0% to 200% of the target grant amount, equally based on two metrics: our three-year cumulative non-GAAP EPS growth relative to a target rate and TSR of our common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of the S&P 500 IT Sector Index over a three-year period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. As of December 25, 2021, 15 million PSUs were outstanding. PSUs vest three years from the grant date. Other RSU awards and option awards generally vest over four years from the grant date. Stock options generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. Share-Based CompensationShare-based compensation recognized in 2021 was $2.0 billion ($1.9 billion in 2020 and $1.7 billion in 2019). During 2021, the tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $377 million ($380 million in 2020 and $359 million in 2019).We estimate the fair value of RSUs with a service condition or performance condition using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our shares of common stock prior to vesting. We estimate the fair value of RSUs with a market condition using a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the date of grant using historical volatility. Restricted Stock UnitsWeighted average assumptions used in estimating grant values were as follows:Dec 25, 2021Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Estimated values$50.82 $54.82 $48.06 Risk-free interest rate0.2 %0.4 %2.3 %Dividend yield2.6 %2.3 %2.5 %Volatility37 %30 %25 %Summary of activities:Number ofStock Units(In Millions)Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair ValueDecember 26, 202082.7 $50.14 Granted76.8 $50.82 Vested(30.2)$47.64 Forfeited(11.3)$49.48 December 25, 2021118.0 $51.29 Expected to vest105.9 $51.47 The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2021 was $1.7 billion ($1.9 billion in 2020 and $1.9 billion in 2019), which represents the market value of our common stock on the date that the RSUs vested. The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2021 was $1.4 billion ($1.3 billion in 2020 and $1.3 billion in 2019). The number of RSUs vested includes shares of common stock that we withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. RSUs that are expected to vest are net of estimated future forfeitures.As of December 25, 2021, unrecognized compensation costs related to RSUs granted under our equity incentive plans were $3.8 billion. We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.Stock Purchase PlanThe 2006 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. Under the 2006 ESPP, 523 million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance through August 2026. As of December 25, 2021, 227 million shares of common stock remained available for issuance. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements104Table of ContentsEmployees purchased 22 million shares of common stock in 2021 for $925 million under the 2006 ESPP (21 million shares of common stock for $876 million in 2020 and 17 million shares of common stock for $688 million in 2019). As of December 25, 2021, unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire shares of common stock under the 2006 ESPP totaled $48 million. We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately two months.Note 19 : Commitments and ContingenciesLeasesWe recognized operating leased assets in other long-term assets of $549 million and corresponding accrued liabilities of $180 million, and other long-term liabilities of $295 million as of December 25, 2021. Our operating leases have remaining terms of 1 to 14 years and may include options to extend the leases for up to 37 years. The weighted average remaining lease term was 3.8 years, and the weighted average discount rate was 2.5% as of December 25, 2021 for our operating leases. Operating lease expense was $798 million in 2021 ($416 million in 2020 and $185 million in 2019), including $620 million in variable lease expense in 2021. In 2021, we signed finance leases for supplier capacity extending over approximately eight years. The leases will commence upon start of supplier production expected in 2023 with prepayments totaling approximately $980 million in 2022 and 2023. These prepayments will be recognized in property, plant and equipment upon payment.Discounted and undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable leases as of December 25, 2021, excluding non-lease components, were as follows:(In Millions)20222023202420252026 ThereafterTotalOperating lease payments$183 $139 $79 $55 $16 $27 $499 Finance lease payments$451 $529 $980 Present value of lease payments$1,455 CommitmentsCommitments for capital expenditures totaled $27.0 billion as of December 25, 2021 ($8.6 billion as of December 26, 2020), a substantial majority of which will be due within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $12.4 billion as of December 25, 2021 (approximately $2.6 billion as of December 26, 2020). Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under supply agreements and various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services relate to agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities, fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, amounts are limited to the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee under the agreement. Legal ProceedingsWe are regularly party to various ongoing claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including those noted in this section. In the first quarter of 2021, we accrued a charge of $2.2 billion related to litigation involving VLSI, described below. Excluding this charge, management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements105Table of ContentsEuropean Commission Competition MatterIn 2001, the EC commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. We received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC and we responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged \"conditional rebates and payments\" that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged \"payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.\" The EC imposed a fine in the amount of €1.1 billion ($1.4 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to \"immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in\" the EC decision.The EC decision contained no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision stated that we should \"cease and desist\" from further conduct that, in the EC's opinion, would violate applicable law. We took steps, which are subject to the EC's ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We had discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices.We appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our appeal took place in July 2012. In June 2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its entirety. In August 2014, we filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In November 2014, Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed comments in support of Intel's grounds of appeal. The EC and interveners filed briefs in November 2014, we filed a reply in February 2015, and the EC filed a rejoinder in April 2015. The Court of Justice held oral argument in June 2016. In October 2016, Advocate General Wahl, an advisor to the Court of Justice, issued a non-binding advisory opinion that favored Intel on a number of grounds. The Court of Justice issued its decision in September 2017, setting aside the judgment of the General Court and sending the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. The General Court appointed a panel of five judges to consider our appeal of the EC's 2009 decision in light of the Court of Justice's clarifications of the law. In November 2017, the parties filed initial \"Observations\" about the Court of Justice's decision and the appeal and were invited by the General Court to offer supplemental comments to each other's \"Observations,\" which the parties submitted in March 2018. Responses to other questions posed by the General Court were filed in May and June 2018. The General Court heard oral argument in March 2020, and on January 26, 2022 issued a decision annulling the EC’s finding against Intel regarding rebates as well as the fine on Intel. Any appeal of the General Court’s decision must be brought before the Court of Justice by early April 2022.Litigation Related to Security VulnerabilitiesIn June 2017, a Google research team notified us and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities (now commonly referred to as \"Spectre\" and \"Meltdown\") that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. On January 3, 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel and, in certain cases, our current and former executives and directors, in US federal and state courts and in certain courts in other countries relating to the Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities, as well as other variants of these vulnerabilities that have since been identified.As of January 25, 2022, consumer class action lawsuits relating to the above class of security vulnerabilities publicly disclosed since 2018 were pending in the United States, Canada, and Israel. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the United States, numerous individual class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated in April 2018 for all pretrial proceedings in the US District Court for the District of Oregon. In March 2020, the court granted Intel's motion to dismiss the complaint in that consolidated action but granted plaintiffs leave to amend. In March 2021, the court granted Intel's motion to dismiss the amended complaint but granted plaintiffs leave to further amend in part. Plaintiffs filed a further amended complaint in May 2021, which Intel moved to dismiss in July 2021. In Canada, in one case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled. In a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec, a stay of the case was in effect until December 2021, and the parties' joint request for a further stay to May 2022 is pending with the court. In Israel, two consumer class action lawsuits were filed in the District Court of Haifa. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the first lawsuit in July 2021. Intel filed a motion to stay the second case pending resolution of the consolidated proceeding in the US, and a hearing on that motion has been scheduled for April 2022. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements106Table of ContentsIn addition to these lawsuits, Intel stockholders filed multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits since January 2018 against certain current and former members of our Board of Directors and certain current and former officers, alleging that the defendants breached their duties to Intel in connection with the disclosure of the security vulnerabilities and the failure to take action in relation to alleged insider trading. The complaints sought to recover damages from the defendants on behalf of Intel. Some of the derivative actions were filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California and were consolidated, and the others were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California in San Mateo County and were consolidated. The federal court granted defendants' motion to dismiss in August 2018 on the ground that plaintiffs failed to plead facts sufficient to show they were excused from making a pre-lawsuit demand on the Board. The federal court granted plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, but subsequently dismissed the cases in January 2019 at plaintiffs' request. The California Superior Court entered judgment in defendants' favor in August 2020 after granting defendants' motions to dismiss plaintiffs' consolidated complaint and three successive amended complaints, all for failure to plead facts sufficient to show plaintiffs were excused from making a pre-lawsuit demand on the Board. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the California court's judgment in October 2020. In January 2021, another Intel stockholder filed a derivative lawsuit in the Superior Court in San Mateo County against certain current and former officers and members of our Board of Directors. The lawsuit asserts claims similar to those dismissed in August 2020, except that it alleges that the stockholder made a pre-lawsuit demand on our Board of Directors and that the demand was wrongfully refused. In May 2021, the court granted defendants' motion to stay the action pending the outcome of any litigation plaintiff may choose to file in Delaware where Intel's bylaws require such claims to be filed.Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay AnnouncementStarting in July 2020, five securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Intel and certain current and former officers based on Intel’s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent classes of acquirers of Intel stock between October 2019 and July 2020, generally allege that the defendants violated securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products in light of subsequently announced delays. In October 2020, the court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs, and in January 2021 the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint in March 2021. We dispute the claims described above and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be  resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. In July 2021, Intel introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now Intel 4.Litigation Related to Patent and IP ClaimsWe have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences v. Intel China, Ltd., et al.In February 2018, the Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMECAS) sued Intel China, Ltd., Dell China, Ltd. (Dell), and Beijing Jingdong Century Information Technology, Ltd. (JD) for patent infringement in the Beijing Higher People's Court. IMECAS alleges that Intel's Core series processors infringe Chinese patent CN 102956457 ('457 Patent). The complaint demands an injunction and damages of at least RMB 200 million plus the cost of litigation. Intel is indemnifying Dell and JD. The Beijing Higher People's Court held a final trial hearing in September 2021. No ruling has been issued. In March 2018, Intel filed an invalidation request on the '457 patent with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA). The CNIPA held an oral hearing in September 2018 and in February 2019 upheld the validity of the challenged claims. Intel filed a complaint in April 2019 with the Beijing Intellectual Property (IP) Court challenging the February 2019 CNIPA ruling. The Beijing IP Court held oral arguments in July and October 2021 and in November 2021 affirmed the CNIPA ruling. In December 2021, Intel filed an appeal with the Supreme People's Court challenging the Beijing IP Court's affirmance of the CNIPA ruling. In January 2020, Intel filed a second invalidation request on the '457 patent with the CNIPA, for which the CNIPA heard oral argument in July 2020 and in November 2020 held the challenged apparatus claims invalid. IMECAS filed a complaint in February 2021 with the Beijing IP Court challenging the November 2020 CNIPA ruling. In December 2020, Intel filed a third invalidation request on the '457 patent with the CNIPA. The CNIPA held an oral hearing in June 2021 and in September 2021 upheld the validity of the challenged claims. Intel filed a complaint in December 2021 with the Beijing IP Court challenging the September 2021 CNIPA ruling. In September 2018 and March 2019, Intel filed petitions with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requesting institution of inter partes review (IPR) of US Patent No. 9,070,719, the US counterpart to the '457 patent. The USPTO denied institution of Intel's petitions in March and October 2019, respectively. In April 2019, Intel filed a request for rehearing and a petition for a Precedential Opinion Panel (POP) in the USPTO to challenge the denial of its first IPR petition, and in November 2019 Intel filed a request for rehearing on the second IPR petition. In January 2020, the USPTO denied the POP petition on the first IPR petition. In June 2020, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) denied Intel's rehearing requests on both petitions. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements107Table of ContentsIn October 2019, IMECAS filed second and third lawsuits in the Beijing IP Court, alleging infringement of Chinese Patent No. CN 102386226 ('226 Patent) based on the manufacturing and sale of Intel® Core i3 microprocessors. Defendants in the second case are Lenovo (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (Lenovo) and Beijing Jiayun Huitong Technology Development Co. Ltd. (BJHT). Defendants in the third case are Intel Corp., Intel China Co., Ltd., the Intel China Beijing Branch, Beijing Digital China Co., Ltd. (Digital China), and JD. The complaint in the second lawsuit demands an injunction plus litigation costs and reserves the right to claim damages in unspecified amounts. Intel is indemnifying Lenovo in the second lawsuit. The Beijing IP Court held a trial hearing in the second lawsuit in November 2021, but no ruling has been issued. The complaint in the third lawsuit demands an injunction plus litigation costs and claims damages of RMB 10 million. Intel China's jurisdictional challenge in the third lawsuit was denied in June 2021 by the Beijing IP Court and in November 2021 by the Supreme People's Court. A trial hearing in the third lawsuit was held in January 2022, but no ruling has been issued. In July 2020, Intel and Lenovo filed invalidation requests on the '226 patent with the CNIPA. The CNIPA heard oral arguments in December 2020, during which IMECAS proposed amendments to two claims. In April 2021, the CNIPA upheld the validity of the challenged and amended claims on both invalidation requests. Intel and Lenovo filed complaints in July 2021 with the Beijing IP Court challenging the April 2021 CNIPA rulings; the Beijing IP Court held oral arguments in October 2021.Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, the unspecified nature and extent of damages claimed by IMECAS, and uncertainty regarding the availability of injunctive relief under applicable law, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters. We dispute IMECAS's claims and intend to vigorously defend against them.VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel In October 2017, VLSI filed a complaint against Intel in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleging infringement of eight patents acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). The patents, which originated at Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. and NXP B.V., are US Patent Nos. 7,268,588; 7,675,806; 7,706,207; 7,709,303; 8,004,922; 8,020,014; 8,268,672; and 8,566,836. VLSI accuses various FPGA and processor products of infringement. VLSI estimated its damages to be at least $5.5 billion, and its complaint further sought enhanced damages, future royalties, attorneys' fees, costs, and interest. In May, June, September, and October 2018, Intel filed IPR petitions challenging the patentability of certain claims in all eight of the patents in-suit. The PTAB instituted review of six patents and denied institution on two patents. As a result of the institution decisions, the parties stipulated to stay the District Court action in March 2019. In December 2019 and February 2020, the PTAB found all claims of the '588 and '303 patents, and some claims of the '922 patent, to be unpatentable. The PTAB found the challenged claims of the '014, '672 and '207 patents to be patentable. Intel appealed the PTAB’s decision as to ‘014, ‘672 and ‘207 patents. The Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB’s decision as to the ‘672 and ‘207 patents, but reversed and remanded as to the ‘014 patent. Intel moved for a continuation of the stay in March 2020 pending the appeal. In June 2020, the District Court issued an order continuing the stay through August 2021. The court lifted the stay in September 2021 and scheduled a trial for March 2024. In June 2018, VLSI filed a second suit against Intel, in US District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement by various Intel processors of five additional patents acquired from NXP: US Patent Nos. 6,212,663; 7,246,027; 7,247,552; 7,523,331; and 8,081,026. VLSI accused Intel of willful infringement and seeks an injunction or, in the alternative, ongoing royalties, enhanced damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and interest. In March 2019, the District Court dismissed VLSI's claims for willful infringement as to all the patents-in-suit except the '027 patent, and also dismissed VLSI's allegations of indirect infringement as to the '633, '331, and '026 patents. In June 2019, Intel filed IPR petitions challenging the patentability of certain claims in all five patents-in-suit. In January 2020, VLSI said that it was no longer asserting any claims of the '633 patent. In January and February 2020, the PTAB instituted review of the '552, '633, '331 and '026 patents, but declined to institute review of the '027 patent. As a result, the District Court stayed the case as to the '026 and '552 patents but allowed the case to proceed on the '027 and '331 patents. In January 2021, the PTAB invalidated certain asserted claims of the '026 patent, and in February the PTAB invalidated all asserted claims of the '552 patent. Both parties filed notices of appeal regarding the PTAB's decision as to the '026 patent in March 2021, and in April 2021, VLSI filed a notice of appeal of the PTAB's decision as to the '552 patent. The case remains stayed as to both of those patents. For the '027 and '331 patents, VLSI is seeking damages of approximately $4.13 billion plus enhanced damages for the '027 patent. Intel is filing summary judgment motions and challenges to expert witnesses in accordance with the court's January 2022 deadline. In March 2019, VLSI filed a third suit against Intel, also in US District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of six more patents acquired from NXP: US Patent Nos. 6,366,522; 6,663,187; 7,292,485; 7,606,983; 7,725,759; and 7,793,025. In April 2019, VLSI voluntarily dismissed this Delaware case without prejudice. In April 2019, VLSI filed three new infringement suits against Intel in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas (WDTX) accusing various Intel processors of infringement. The three suits collectively assert the same six patents from the voluntarily dismissed Delaware case plus two additional patents acquired from NXP, US Patent Nos. 7,523,373 and 8,156,357. VLSI accuses Intel of willful infringement and seeks an injunction or, in the alternative, ongoing royalties, enhanced damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and interest. In the first Texas case, VLSI asserted the '373 and '759 patents (in December 2020, the court granted Intel summary judgment of non-infringement on the '357 patent, which had also been asserted in the first Texas case). That case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded a “lump sum” to VLSI of $1.5 billion for literal infringement of the ‘373 patent and $675 million for infringement under the doctrine of equivalents of the ‘759 patent. The jury found that Intel had not willfully infringed either patent. Intel has challenged the verdict with post-trial motions, including filing in May 2021 a motion for a new trial and a motion for judgment as a matter of law that the ‘373 and ‘759 patents are not infringed and the ‘759 patent is invalid. The court denied the motion for new trial in August 2021, but other post-trial motions, including the motion for judgment as a matter of law, remain pending. If the court does not vacate the verdict, Intel will challenge it on appeal. The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that Intel does not infringe the ‘522 and ‘187 patents. VLSI had sought approximately $3.0 billion for alleged infringement of those patents, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet entered a judgment following the first or second trials in Texas.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements108Table of ContentsThe third Texas case has been postponed and is not currently set for trial. In that case, VLSI seeks approximately $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion for alleged infringement of the ‘983, ‘025 and ‘485 patents, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. In October and November 2019 and in February 2020, Intel filed IPR petitions on certain asserted claims across six of the patents-in-suit in WDTX. Between May and October 2020, the PTAB denied all of these petitions on a discretionary basis and without reviewing the merits. Intel requested a rehearing, as well as review from the POP, as to all petitions. All requests for POP review and rehearing were denied. Intel filed notices of appeal regarding the discretionary denials for all petitions in February and March of 2021. The Federal Circuit dismissed the appeals in May 2021 for lack of jurisdiction. The Federal Circuit denied Intel's petition for hearing en banc in August 2021. In December 2021, Intel petitioned the Supreme Court to hear its appeal as to whether the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction to review the PTAB’s discretionary denials of Intel’s IPRs.In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserts Chinese Patent 201410094015.9, accusing certain Intel Core processors of infringement. VLSI requests an injunction as well as RMB 1 million in damages and RMB 300 thousand in expenses. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the CNIPA, which held a hearing in September 2021. In May 2020, defendants filed a motion to stay the trial court proceedings pending a determination on invalidity. The court held the first evidentiary hearing in November 2020 and the second in July 2021. The court also held trial proceedings in the hearing in July 2021 and concluded that further trial proceedings were needed but indicated those would be stayed pending the outcome of defendants’ invalidity challenge at the CNIPA. In July 2021, VLSI dismissed its case, but refiled it in August 2021. In November 2021, Intel moved for a stay of the August 2021 action pending a ruling on invalidity. The court has not yet ruled on that motion.In May 2019, VLSI filed a second case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserts Chinese Patent 201080024173.7. VLSI accuses certain Intel Core processors and seeks an injunction, as well as RMB 1 million in damages and RMB 300 thousand in expenses. Defendants filed with the CNIPA an invalidation petition in October 2019 and the CNIPA held a hearing in September 2021, but has not yet issued a decision. In June 2020, defendants filed a motion to stay the trial court proceedings pending a determination on invalidity. The court held its first evidentiary hearing in September 2020. The court held a second evidentiary hearing in December 2020, and a trial the same month. At trial, VLSI dropped its monetary damages claim, but still requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an injunction. The court has not yet issued a decision following the trial. Rather, the court stayed the case in December 2020 pending a determination on invalidity by the CNIPA.In November 2019, Intel, along with Apple Inc., filed a complaint against Fortress Investment Group LLC, Fortress Credit Co. LLC, Uniloc 2017 LLC, Uniloc USA, Inc., Uniloc Luxembourg S.A.R.L., VLSI, INVT SPE LLC, Inventergy Global, Inc., DSS Technology Management, Inc., IXI IP, LLC, and Seven Networks, LLC. Plaintiffs allege violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act by certain defendants, Section 7 of the Clayton Act by certain defendants, and California Business and Professions Code section 17200 by all defendants based on defendants' unlawful aggregation of patents. In 2020 and 2021, the court twice dismissed plaintiffs' complaint with leave to amend. In December 2020, the court granted a joint motion by Apple and Seven Networks to dismiss with prejudice Apple’s claims against Seven Networks. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in March 2021. Defendants moved to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint in May 2021. Apple withdrew from the case and dismissed its claims in June 2021. The court heard defendants’ motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint in September 2021, and dismissed Intel’s claims with prejudice that same month, entering judgment in favor of defendants. Intel filed a notice of appeal in December 2021.In June 2020, affiliates controlled by Fortress Investment Group, which also controls VLSI, acquired Finjan Holdings, Inc. Intel had signed a \"Settlement, Release and Patent License Agreement\" with Finjan in 2012, acquiring a license to the patents of Finjan and its affiliates, current or future, through a capture period of November 20, 2022. The agreement also contains covenants wherein Finjan agrees to cause its affiliates to comply with the agreement. As such, Intel maintains that it now has a license to the patents of VLSI, which has become a Finjan affiliate, and that Finjan must cause VLSI to dismiss its suits against Intel. In August 2020, Intel started dispute resolution proceedings under the agreement. As a part of this dispute resolution process, Intel and Finjan held a mediation in December 2020, but failed to resolve their differences. Intel filed suit to enforce its rights under the License Agreement with Finjan in January 2021 in Delaware Chancery Court. In March 2021, defendants filed motions to dismiss the Chancery Court proceedings. The court heard those motions in May 2021, and dismissed all of Intel’s claims—except the breach of contract claim—with prejudice in September 2021 for lack of jurisdiction because, the court reasoned, Intel’s license defense has been raised in the other US suits between Intel and VLSI and could be adjudicated in one of those actions. The court stayed Intel’s breach of contract claim pending a determination on whether Intel is licensed to VLSI’s patents. In September 2020, Intel filed motions to stay the Texas, Delaware, and Shanghai matters pending resolution of its dispute with Finjan. In November 2020, Intel filed a motion to stay the Shenzhen matter pending resolution of its dispute with Finjan. In November 2020, the Delaware court denied Intel's motion to stay. The other stay motions remain pending. Finally, Intel filed a motion to amend its answer in the Texas matters to add a license defense in November 2020, and filed a motion to amend its answer in the Delaware matter to add a license defense in February 2021. The Texas court has not yet ruled on Intel’s motion to amend, but the Delaware court granted Intel’s motion in July 2021. In June 2021, OpenSky Industries LLC (OpenSky) requested IPR of certain claims of the ‘373 and ‘759 patents, including the ones a jury said Intel infringes. Both petitions copied Intel’s earlier petitions, and used the expert declarations previously submitted by Intel. Another entity named Patent Quality Assurance LLC (PQA) also petitioned for IPR of certain claims of the ’373 patent, including ones a jury said Intel infringes. PQA also largely copied Intel’s petition, but added a challenge to an additional claim and included newly signed declarations from Intel’s experts. In December 2021, the PTAB instituted OpenSky’s petition on the ‘759 patent, but declined to institute on the ‘373 patent. In December 2021, Intel filed a motion to join OpenSky’s ‘759 IPR. A decision on PQA’s IPR petition is expected in January 2022. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements109Table of ContentsAfter consideration of the verdicts in the WDTX cases and the additional pending lawsuits filed by VLSI, Intel accrued a charge of $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021.

Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on management's evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 25, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with US GAAP.Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Management's assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment.Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP. We reviewed the results of management's assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting, as stated in the firm's attestation report, which is included within Financial Statements and Supplemental Details.

Table of ContentsOrganization of Our Form 10-K The order and presentation of content in our Form 10-K differs from the traditional SEC Form 10-K format. Our format is designed to improve readability and better present how we organize and manage our business. See \"Form 10-K Cross-Reference Index\" within the Financial Statements and Supplemental Details for a cross-reference index to the traditional SEC Form 10-K format. To reflect our focus on transforming from a PC-centric1 company to a data-centric company, we have presented our data-centric businesses1 first in the \"Segment Trends and Results\" within MD&A.We have defined certain terms and abbreviations used throughout our Form 10-K in \"Key Terms\" within the Financial Statements and Supplemental Details.

The dynamic of work and learn from home resulted in strong demand for notebook PCs, while demand for desktop PCs weakened. Demand in the DCG cloud service providers market segment grew, while enterprise and government declined on macroeconomic weakness. We shipped a higher volume of 10nm products than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. The increased mix of 10nm, combined with a higher portion of revenue from lower margin adjacent businesses, offset higher platform revenue and drove a decline in gross margin of 3 percentage points. We invested $13.6 billion in R&D, reduced our spending to 25.3% of revenue, and signed an agreement to divest our NAND memory business. We made capital investments of $14.3 billion, and generated $35.4 billion cash from operations and $21.1 billion of free cash flow. We also returned $19.8 billion to stockholders, including $5.6 billion in dividends and $14.2 billion in buybacks.\"We achieved record revenue for the fifth consecutive year and maintained a strong balance sheet and liquidity position.

The world is changing and driving the need for exponentially more computing. First we experienced the PC era, followed by the mobile and cloud era. We are now entering the era of distributed intelligence, where computing is pervasive and so many things in our lives—our homes, our cars, our hospitals, and our cities—now function like computers. In this world of distributed intelligence, our three fastest growing opportunities are AI, 5G network transformation, and the intelligent and autonomous edge. We have a history of transforming to capitalize on market shifts, and we are in the midst of another significant transformation to position ourselves and our customers for growth. With our focus on execution and re-energized culture as a force multiplier, we are transforming from a CPU to a multi-architecture xPU company, from silicon to platforms, and from a traditional IDM to a new, modern IDM. Our priorities are to strengthen our core, extend our reach, and redefine our position in the industry. Our capital provides a foundation to invest in our growth and to supplement and strengthen our capabilities. We are thoughtfully deploying capital and focusing our investment in differentiated technologies where we can play a bigger role in the success of our customers and deliver attractive returns to our stockholders. Our PrioritiesImprove Execution to Strengthen Our CoreWe have made changes that help position us to sharpen our operational excellence and process technology. We have streamlined our product roadmaps, evolved our technical organization to drive greater transparency and accountability, and exited businesses to enable focus on our core strategy. Technical talent. Our leadership team has deep technical, engineering, and business expertise and is focused on our opportunities. We are re-energizing our culture to drive better business outcomes for our customers by instilling a growth mindset, increasing accountability around shared company goals, implementing new operational protocols, and renewing a sense of purpose and value to create an environment for innovation and growth.Continuous innovation.

With these six areas, we are creating innovative xPU platforms that uniquely serve diverse new workload opportunities, and transforming from silicon to platforms to solve customers' problems through complete solutions offerings.Predictable cadence. We have made an architectural shift to die disaggregation that, when combined with our differentiated advanced packaging, creates flexibility to use the process that best serves our customers and supports our ability to deliver on a predictable cadence. Disaggregated design allows us to manufacture different components of a chip on different processes: some components can benefit from the greater performance of the latest process node, while others can leverage lower-cost nodes where differentiated performance is not needed. Through disaggregated design, we mix and match architectures, IP, process nodes, and silicon from our own manufacturing facilities or from external foundries. Fundamentals of Our Business6Table of ContentsNew, modern IDM. We are investing to transform our traditional IDM model to adapt to an evolving industry. This means creating greater flexibility to use internal or external foundry processes. It requires that we continue to lead advances in silicon technology by leaning into our expertise and manufacturing scale, while evolving to engage with the ecosystem in new and different ways. It also requires that we leverage our disaggregated design capabilities and continue to manufacture new products with significant cost advantage. We will also continue to invest in process technology development to bring to market the future process nodes and advanced packaging capabilities that create product differentiation and customization, while also enabling manufacturing optionality.Evolving our engagement with the broader silicon manufacturing and design ecosystem involves working as a strategic partner with equipment vendors, EDA providers, and third-party foundries to help enhance the performance of our manufacturing tools, optimize design software for our processes, simplify design, improve efficiency, and standardize components. This also involves increasing the strategic use of third-party IP for standardized components to allow us to focus on differentiating technology, and updating our design methodologies to support movement of our designs to and from external foundries. Extend Our Reach to Accelerate Our GrowthDiverse product portfolio to capitalize on the fastest growing opportunities. The proliferation of data analytics, edge computing, and AI is driving a diverse and expanding range of computing applications from edge to cloud. In response, we are innovating to deliver products including a mix of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial architectures deployed in CPUs, GPUs, accelerators, and FPGAs—unified by an open, industry-standard programming model, oneAPI, to simplify application development.AI helps our customers make sense of data to unleash its potential.

We have returned 95% of free cash flow to investors over the past five years. Cash from Operating Activities $B■ Capital Investment■ Free Cash Flow1Our Financial Capital Allocation Decisions Are Driven by Three PrioritiesInvest in the BusinessAcquire and IntegrateReturn Cash to StockholdersOur first allocation priority is to invest in R&D and capital spending to strengthen our competitive position. We are efficiently maintaining our R&D investment as a percentage of revenue and continue to make significant capital investments, increasing our 14nm and 10nm wafer capacity. We also invested in 7nm and future process development. In addition to our own manufacturing capacity, we continue to use third-party foundries to expand the ways we can support our customers.Our second allocation priority is to invest in companies around the world that will complement our strategic objectives and stimulate growth of data-centric opportunities. We look for acquisitions that leverage and strengthen our capital and R&D investments. In 2020, we completed various acquisitions to expand our product offerings and the markets we serve. Those acquisitions included Moovit, which accelerates our MaaS offering and brings Mobileye closer to achieving our plan to become a complete mobility provider, including robotaxi services. We take action when investments do not meet our criteria, and in 2020 we divested the majority of our Home Gateway Platform division and signed an agreement to divest our NAND memory business.Our third allocation priority is to return cash to stockholders. We achieve this through our dividend and share repurchase programs. In March, we suspended stock repurchases in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and in August we entered into $10.0 billion in ASR agreements in response to our belief that our stock was trading below its intrinsic valuation at that time. In Q1 2021, we intend to complete the remaining $2.4 billion of our $20.0 billion planned repurchases announced in October 2019. During 2020, we paid $5.6 billion in dividends and repurchased $14.2 billion in shares. Our approach has reduced diluted shares outstanding over time.

Successful R&D efforts can lead to new products and technologies or improvements to existing ones, which we seek to protect through our IP rights. We may augment our R&D initiatives by acquiring or investing in companies, entering into R&D agreements, and directly purchasing or licensing technology.Areas Key to Product LeadershipEvery year we make significant investments in R&D and we have intensified our focus on areas key to product leadership. Our objective is to improve user experiences and value through advances in performance, power, cost, connectivity, security, form factor, and other features with each new generation of products. We are also focused on reducing our design complexity, re-using IP, and increasing ecosystem collaboration to improve our efficiency, including a significant reduction of design rules for future process nodes.Process and packaging. We are creating a new wave of compute engines that mix and match different process technologies and then connect them with high-performance, low-power packaging technologies like EMIB1 and Foveros1, the industry's first implementation of stacked processing components. This disaggregated design approach allows us to manufacture different components of a chip on different processes, giving us the flexibility to use the process that best serves our customers.▪We launched our Intel Core processors with Intel® Hybrid Technology, also referred to as Lakefield, which use Foveros 3D stacking technology to achieve a dramatic reduction in package area.▪We introduced our 10nm SuperFin Technology, a redefinition of the FinFET with new SuperMIM capacitors. It enables the largest single intranode enhancement in our history. We are planning further 10nm intranode enhancements.xPU architecture. The future is a diverse mix of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial architectures deployed in CPU, GPU, accelerator, and FPGAsockets, enabled by a scalable software stack and integrated into systems by advanced packaging technology.

We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. For a detailed discussion of our IP rights, see \"Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing\" within Other Key Information.\"In addition to pledging funds, Intel gave COVID-19 scientists and researchers free access to our vast worldwide intellectual property portfolio this year in the hope and belief that making this intellectual property freely available to them will save lives. We will continue to invent—and protect—our intellectual property, but we offered it freely to those working to protect people from the pandemic.\"—Steve Rodgers, Executive Vice President and General CounselManufacturing CapitalWe are transforming from a traditional IDM to a modern IDM by investing to lead advances in silicon technology, leaning into our expertise and manufacturing scale, while evolving to engage with the ecosystem and leveraging our disaggregated design capabilities. Unlike many other semiconductor companies, we primarily design and manufacture our products in our own manufacturing facilities and we will continue to integrate engineering and manufacturing to provide new products with significant cost advantage. At the same time, our architectural shift to die disaggregation allows us to mix and match architectures, IP, process nodes, and silicon that creates increasing flexibility for our products. In developing new generations of manufacturing process technology, we seek to realize the benefits from Moore's Law, a law of economics predicted by our co-founder Gordon Moore more than 50 years ago. Realizing Moore's Law can create economic benefits as we are able to either reduce a chip's cost as we shrink its size, or increase functionality and performance of a chip while maintaining the same cost with higher density. This makes possible the innovation of new products with higher performance while balancing power efficiency, cost, and size to meet customers' needs. Our ability to optimize and apply our manufacturing expertise to deliver more advanced, differentiated products has been foundational to our success and is a continued focus of our investments.\"The IDM model has been foundational to Intel's success as a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing by enabling product optimization, improved economics, and supply assurance.

Our supply chain ecosystem comprises thousands of suppliers globally. Our worldwide site expansion projects remained on track despite disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to our own manufacturing capacity, we continue to use third-party foundries to expand the ways in which we can support our customers. These third-party solutions complement our manufacturing and provide additional flexibility. Our world-class safety standards and supply chain operations, including our robust risk management and crisis response model, have to date allowed our worldwide factory and supply chain network to continue to operate safely and with mostly on-time deliveries despite the pandemic. \"As Intel pursues an expanded data-centric market, our collaboration with our wide-ranging supplier ecosystem is deeper, more vibrant, and farther reaching than ever. Together with the ecosystem, we are focused on enabling technology advancements to deliver uninterrupted supply of leadership products to our customers.\"—Dr. Randhir Thakur, Corporate Vice President and Chief Supply Chain OfficerThe majority of our logic wafer manufacturing is conducted in the U.S. We have 10 manufacturing sites—six are wafer fabrication, three are assembly/test facilities, and our Costa Rica site added in 2020 is a test-only site. The following map shows our present factory sites and the countries where we have a significant R&D and/or sales presence. In response to COVID-19, we quickly made operational changes and adopted measures to enable a continued safe environment for our employees and operation of our manufacturing sites.Our manufacturing facilities are primarily used for silicon wafer manufacturing, assembling, and testing of our platform and memory products. We operate in a network of manufacturing facilities integrated as one factory to provide the most flexible supply capacity, allowing us to better analyze our production costs and adapt to changes in capacity needs. Our new process technologies are transferred identically from a central development fab to each manufacturing facility. After transfer, the network of factories and the development fab collaborate to continue driving operational improvements. This enables fast ramp of the operation, fast learning, and better quality control. Our NAND memory fabrication facility in Dalian, China is included in the transaction entered into with SK hynix to divest our NAND memory business, and is part of the NAND assets held for sale as of December 26, 2020. Our Intel Optane memory business is expressly excluded from this transaction. The next generations of Intel Optane technology and SSDs are being developed in New Mexico following the sale of our non-controlling interest in IMFT to Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) in 2019. We will continue to purchase product manufactured by Micron under our supply agreement, which includes the next generation of Intel® 3D XPointTM technology. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital12Table of ContentsHuman CapitalCulture is critically important to Intel's success. We are re-energizing our culture to deliver on our corporate purpose and to attract, develop, and retain top talent needed to build transformative products and services that help our customers succeed in an increasingly data-driven world. We invest in our highly-skilled global workforce of 110,600 people by seeking to create a diverse, inclusive, and safe work environment where our employees can learn, innovate, and deliver their workplace best every day.Our values—fearless, inclusion, customer-obsessed, one Intel, truth and transparency, and quality—guide how we make decisions, treat each other, and serve our customers. All employees are responsible for upholding these values, the Intel Code of Conduct, and Intel's Global Human Rights Principles, which form the foundation of our policies and practices and ethical business culture.\"People with diverse perspectives, experiences, and input are critical to Intel’s innovation, playing important roles in key projects and programs across the company. An essential element of our growth strategy is to build a culture that empowers and inspires employees to collaborate and create, as we strive to become the most inclusive workplace on the planet.\"—Sandra Rivera, Executive Vice President and Chief People OfficerInclusionDiversity and inclusion are core to Intel's values and instrumental in driving innovation and delivering stronger business growth. We achieved our 2020 goal of full representation in our U.S. workforce two years ahead of schedule, the result of an integrated strategy focused on hiring, retention, and progression. We are proud of what we have accomplished to advance diversity and inclusion, but we recognize we still have work to do, including beyond the walls of Intel. Our RISE strategy and 2030 goals set our global ambitions for the next decade, including doubling the number of women in senior leadership; exceeding 40% female representation in technical roles, including engineering positions and other roles with technical job requirements; increasing the percentage of employees who self-identify as having a disability to 10%; and ensuring accountability for embedding inclusive leadership practices across our business. Our goals also include doubling the number of underrepresented minorities in U.S. senior leadership. To drive accountability, we continue to link a portion of our executive and employee compensation to diversity and inclusion metrics. Today's greatest challenges require a shared commitment to a plan and meaningful action. That is why we have committed our scale, expertise, and reach through our comprehensive RISE strategy to work with customers and other stakeholders to accelerate the adoption of inclusive business practices across industries. We are creating and implementing a Global Inclusion Index and convening a coalition of companies to focus on unified goals and metrics that will be shared through the index. This collective effort will allow the industry to more clearly identify actions needed to advance progress. We will also continue to collaborate on initiatives that expand the diverse pipeline of talent for our industry, advance social equity, make technology fully inclusive, and expand digital readiness for millions of people around the world. Compensation and BenefitsWe strive to provide pay, benefits, and services that help meet the varying needs of our employees. Our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave, parent reintegration, fertility assistance, flexible work schedules, sabbaticals, and on-site services. Since 2019, we have achieved gender pay equity globally and we continued to maintain race/ethnicity pay equity in the U.S. We achieve pay equity by closing the gap in average pay between employees of different genders or race/ethnicity in the same or similar roles after accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences, such as location, time at grade level, and tenure. We also advanced transparency in our pay and representation data by publicly releasing our EEO-1 survey pay data in 2019. Although the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission did not require employers to file EEO-1 survey pay data in 2020 due to COVID-19, we felt it was important to continue collecting the data and to disclose it publicly in 2020. We believe that our holistic approach toward pay equity, representation, and creating an inclusive culture enables us to cultivate a workplace that helps employees develop and progress in their careers at all levels.To aid and support employees during COVID-19, we are investing more than $100 million in additional benefits, including special recognition for employees working on site. We also put in place a telecommuting reimbursement program to help employees required to work from home improve their workspaces, and increased flexibility in our leave programs to support employees caring for children and others.1    Senior leadership refers to salary grades 10+ and equivalent grades. While we present male and female, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing of all gender identities.2    The term underrepresented minority (URM) is used to describe diverse populations, including African American, Hispanic, and Native American employees in the U.S.  Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital13Table of ContentsGrowth and DevelopmentWe invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Intel an employer of choice. We offer extensive training programs and provide rotational assignment opportunities. We implemented a new performance management system to support our culture evolution and to increase focus on continuous learning and development. Through our regular Employee Experience Surveys, employees can voice their perceptions of the company and their work experience, including learning and development opportunities. Our undesired turnover rate was 4% in 2020.Health, Safety, and WellnessOur commitment in Intel's Environmental, Health, and Safety Policy is to provide a safe and injury-free workplace. We continually invest in programs designed to improve physical, mental, and social well-being. We provide access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs, including on-site health centers, which were increasingly critical this year for our essential workers who have worked on site since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout our response to COVID-19, our priority has remained protecting the health and safety of our employees. Intel's Pandemic Leadership Team—which has been in place for 15 years—regularly reviews and adapts our policies based on evolving research and guidance related to the virus. In support of our 2030 goals, we will continue to build our strong safety culture and drive global expansion of our corporate wellness program through continued employee education and engagement activities.Social and Relationship CapitalWe are committed to engaging in corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives that support our communities and help us develop trusted relationships with our stakeholders. Proactive engagement with our stakeholders and investments in social impact initiatives, including those aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, advance our position as a leading corporate citizen and create shared value for Intel, our global supply chain, and our communities.Economic and social. The health of our business and local economies depends on continued investments in innovation. We provide high-skill, high-paying jobs around the world. Many of these are manufacturing and R&D jobs located in our own domestic and international factories. We also benefit economies through our R&D ecosystem spending, sourcing activities, consumer spending by our employees, and tax payments. We make sizable capital investments and provide leadership in public-private partnerships to spur economic growth and innovation.We stand at the forefront of new technologies that are increasingly being used to empower individuals, companies, and governments around the world to solve major societal challenges. We also aim to empower people through education and advance social initiatives to create career pathways into the technology industry. This has included our global Intel AI for Youth program, scaled in partnership with governments and institutions to empower youth with digital readiness and AI skills, as well as our multi-year partnerships with historically black colleges and universities in the U.S. aimed at increasing the number of African Americans who pursue electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science fields. Our employees and retirees actively share their expertise through volunteer initiatives in the communities where we operate. These efforts contributed more than 10 million hours of service over the past decade, and our new goals include a commitment to volunteer an additional 10 million hours by 2030. In 2020, we volunteered 910 thousand hours. COVID-19 presented challenges for in-person volunteering, resulting in lower reported volunteer hours compared to prior years. However, we saw an outpouring of support from employees for virtual volunteering, donations, and innovative technology projects to support our communities.  In April, we announced the Pandemic Response Technology Initiative, a commitment of $50 million to combat COVID-19. Our focus is to leverage our technology, expertise, resources, and our global ecosystem, to accelerate access to technology that can combat the current pandemic and get ahead of future pandemics through scientific discovery, enable remote learning for students, and aid in economic recovery. To date, we have partnered with many organizations on numerous projects across sectors, including technology, healthcare, education, industrial, retail, transportation, and academia.Human rights commitment. We are committed to maintaining and improving processes to avoid human rights violations related to our operations, supply chain, and products. We have established an integrated approach to managing human rights across our business, including board-level oversight and the involvement of senior-level Management Review Committees. We also meet throughout the year with external stakeholders and experts on human rights to continue to inform and evolve our human rights policies and oversight processes. While we do not always know nor can we control what products our customers create or the applications end users may develop, we do not tolerate our products being used to violate human rights. Where we become aware of a concern that Intel products are being used by a business partner in connection with abuses of human rights, we restrict or cease business with the third party until we have high confidence that Intel's products are not being used to violate human rights. As a result, in 2020 we restricted certain sales based on our Human Rights Principles that would have otherwise been considered lawful.Supply Chain ResponsibilityWe actively manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve overall performance and value creation for Intel, our customers, and our suppliers. To drive responsible and sustainable practices throughout our supply chain, we have robust programs to educate and engage suppliers that support our global manufacturing operations. We actively collaborate with other companies and lead industry initiatives on key issues such as improving transparency around climate and water impacts in the global electronics supply chain and, as part of our RISE strategy, we will advance collaboration across our industry on responsible minerals sourcing. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital14Table of ContentsOver the past decade, we have directly engaged with our suppliers to verify compliance and build capacity to address risks of forced and bonded labor and other human rights issues. We perform supplier audits and identify critical direct suppliers to engage through capability-building programs, which help suppliers build sustainability acumen and verify compliance with the Responsible Business Alliance and our Code of Conduct. The suppliers covered by these audits represent 78% of cash payments made to managed suppliers. We also engage with indirect suppliers through our programs on forced and bonded labor, responsible minerals, and supplier diversity. Although COVID-19 presented travel and safety challenges in 2020 that impacted our ability to complete as many in-person supplier audits as in the previous year, we continued to engage with our suppliers and communicate our expectations and requirements. To achieve our 2030 goals, we will significantly expand the number of suppliers covered by our engagement activities to deepen accountability for human rights.Our commitment to diversity and inclusion also extends to our suppliers. We believe a diverse supply chain supports greater innovation and value for our business. We achieved our 2020 goal to reach $1 billion in annual spending with diverse-owned suppliers and our new 2030 goals include doubling this figure over the next decade. Beginning in 2021, we will not retain or use outside law firms in the U.S. that are average or below average on diversity for their equity partners. We are applying a similar rule to firms used by our tax department, including non-legal firms.Natural CapitalDriving to the lowest environmental footprint possible helps create efficiencies, lower costs, and respond to the needs of our stakeholders. We invest in conservation projects and set company-wide environmental targets to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, water use, and waste generation. We build energy efficiency into our products to help our customers lower their own emissions and energy costs, and we collaborate with policymakers and other stakeholders to use technology to address environmental challenges. We achieved our 2020 greenhouse gas goal, reducing our emissions 39% on a per unit basis from 2010 levels. Through our 2030 goals we will continue to drive to higher levels of operational efficiency, including a further 10% reduction in our carbon emissions on an absolute basis even as we continue to grow. Our 2030 strategy and goals also focus on improving product energy efficiency and increasing our \"handprint\"—the ways in which Intel technologies can help others reduce their footprints, including Internet of Things solutions that enable intelligence in machines, buildings, supply chains, and factories, and make electrical grids smarter, safer, and more efficient. Climate and EnergyWe focus on reducing our own climate impact, and over the past two decades have reduced our direct emissions and indirect emissions associated with energy consumption. We achieved our 2020 energy goal, saving more than 4.5 billion kWh since 2012 by investing in energy conservation projects in our global operations. In 2020, we conserved more than 155 million kWh of energy in support of our new 2030 goal to conserve an additional 4 billion kWh of energy over the next 10 years. In addition to conserving energy, we invest in green power and on-site alternative energy projects that provide power directly to our buildings. We continue to link a portion of our executive and employee compensation to corporate responsibility metrics. In 2020, these included a climate-related metric to use 75% renewable energy globally during the year, which supports our 2030 goal to achieve 100% renewable energy use across our global manufacturing operations. In 2020, we signed on to RE100, a global coalition of businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity use. We are committed to transparency around our carbon footprint and climate risk and use the framework developed by the TCFD to inform our disclosure on climate governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. For governance and strategy, we follow an integrated approach to address climate change, with multiple teams responsible for managing climate-related activities, initiatives, and policies. Strategies and progress toward goals are reviewed with senior executives and the Intel Board of Directors' Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. We describe our overall risk management processes in our Proxy Statement, and describe our climate-related risks and opportunities in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, the Intel Climate Change Policy, and \"Risk Factors\" within this Form 10-K. In addition to what is included within this Form 10-K, results of our 2020 goals and information on our 2030 goals, are included in our Corporate Responsibility Report. Our Corporate Responsibility Report includes a mapping of our disclosure to the TCFD, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework, and our CDP Climate Change Survey, all available on our website.1 Water StewardshipWater is essential to the semiconductor manufacturing process. We use ultrapure water to remove impurities from our silicon wafers, and we use fresh and reclaimed water to run our manufacturing facility systems. Over the past decade, our sustainable water management efforts and partnerships have enabled us to conserve billions of gallons of water, and through our 2030 goals we have committed to conserve an additional 60 billion gallons in this decade. As part of this commitment, we plan to achieve net positive water use globally. In 2020, we linked a portion of our executive and employee compensation to our target to conserve more than 5 billion gallons of water in our operations and fund new water restoration projects in collaboration with environmental and community partners that restore more than 1 billion gallons of water during the year to local watersheds. 1    The contents of our website and our Corporate Responsibility Report, Climate Change Policy, and CDP Climate Change Survey are referenced for general information only and are not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. Fundamentals of Our BusinessOur Capital15Table of ContentsCircular Economy and Waste ManagementWe have long been committed to waste management, recycling, and circular economy strategies that enable the recovery and productive re-use of waste streams.

The future of technology is being shaped by the rise of several technology inflections: ▪The levels of efficiency and scale that cloud architectures brought to the data center are now being extended to the network and edge. Workloads are no longer static between enterprises and public clouds; they are distributed to a mix of hybrid and multi-cloud.▪5G will enable rich new experiences and services, fundamentally changing the way we think of compute and requiring most networks to transform.▪AI is fundamental and becoming pervasive in all applications, and is enabling customers to leverage the power of data.▪The edge is demanding more and more compute closer to where data is being created and consumed, driving a new wave of multifunction, compute-hungry devices.Data centers—whether in the cloud, the network, or at the edge—will go through a massive architectural transformation in the coming years, leveraging heterogeneous computing with different types of processor architectures optimized for different workloads. With unmatched scale, portfolio breadth, and ecosystem support, we are uniquely positioned to unlock the value of data for people, business, and society on a global scale. Cloud revenue grew in 2020, driven by rapidly expanding hyperscaler demand for capacity, peaking in the first half with inventory digestion throughout the remainder of the year. The on-premises enterprise business experienced cyclical declines due to sustained COVID-19 workplace trends and macroeconomic uncertainty; enterprise customers continue to embrace cloud as an alternative to traditional legacy architectures. The communications service providers segment continued to grow, accelerating the global transformation of the network and edge through 5G-enabled solutions.Products and CompetitivenessWe offer customers a broad portfolio of silicon and software designed to provide workload-optimized performance across compute, storage, and network. As a leading provider of data center platforms, we face competition from competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), providers of GPU products such as NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA), companies using ARM* architecture, new entrants developing products customized for specific data center workloads, and internally developed solutions by cloud service providers and others. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in 2021.We are now shipping our 10nm-based 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors (previously referred to as Ice Lake). In 2020, we introduced our 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors (previously referred to as Cooper Lake) accompanied by the Intel Optane DC persistent memory 200 series. As the industry's only mainstream data center CPUs with built-in AI acceleration, Intel Xeon processors are helping customers solve problems and gain insight for future opportunities. We also collaborated with 5G leaders to design the world's first standard, high-volume silicon for radio access networks, the Intel Atom P5900 processor, designed from the ground up for 5G wireless base stations.

Our product portfolio employs a broad set of technologies, covering computer vision and machine learning-based sensing, data analysis, localization, mapping, and driving policy technology for ADAS and AVs. Mobileye's ADAS products form the building blocks for higher levels of autonomy. Our customers and strategic partners include major global OEMs, Tier 1 automotive system integrators, fleet managers, and transportation operators. Highlights and Segment Imperatives■We achieved record revenue in 2020 despite a significant decline in global vehicle production related to COVID-19 in the first half of the year. Our EyeQ SoC volume grew approximately 12% and we expect to see additional growth in the adoption of enhanced ADAS technologies.\"The trinity of Mobileye's vision is based on a unique interplay between ADAS and AV realms, a full-fledged mapping solution, and an industry-first formal model for safety. With the past year's significant progress and achievements, we completed another leap in executing our vision for autonomous mobility solutions.\"—Prof. Amnon Shashua, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mobileye■Despite unprecedented challenges to the auto industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we secured more than 37 new design wins, including deals with major OEMs such as Geely and Ford. We are currently active in 49 production programs1 across over 25 OEMs.■We expanded our relationship with Ford, providing our suite of EyeQ sensing technology to support Ford's Co-Pilot360TM Technology driver-assist features, which will be visible in vehicles with Mobileye's logo on display. We also announced a large-scale deal with Chinese automaker Geely to provide Mobileye Supervision, our new ADAS solution. This win marks the first time Mobileye will be responsible for the full solution stack, including hardware and software, driving policy, and control. ■We acquired Moovit to accelerate Mobileye's MaaS offering. Moovit is known for its urban mobility application and brings Mobileye closer to achieving our plan to become a complete mobility provider, including robotaxi services.4-Year Trends2  ■ Revenue $B■ Op Income $BMarket and Business OverviewMarket Trends and StrategyThe COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the global vehicle industry, resulting in a year over year decline in overall production of approximately 17%3, and delayed deployment of certain OEMs' advanced features and other projects. We expect ADAS volume to recover from the effects of COVID-19 faster than overall global vehicle production, and we expect long-term growth of ADAS to remain unaffected as consumers increasingly consider ADAS a differentiating factor in their automotive purchasing decisions. The continued growth of ADAS is dependent on various factors, including regulation, market demand, and consumers' recognition of its value. Mobileye's ADAS solutions also serve as a qualification space for our autonomous technology, using vast experience and proliferation to validate and constantly improve AV technology. This year, we introduced Mobileye Supervision, the EyeQ5-based solution that incorporates an end-to-end engine control unit, surround-view camera array, processors, driving policy, and high-definition maps—all derived directly from our ongoing autonomous vehicle program. AV technologies such as Mobileye Supervision will make their way into premium ADAS solutions, broadening monetization opportunities and value proposition. 1  This refers to the total number of production programs with active project managers. Intel's definition of program is included in \"Key Terms\" within the Financial Statements and Supplemental Details. 2 Mobileye was acquired in Q3 2017; 2017 results do not represent the full year. 3 Source: IHS MarkitMD&A25Table of ContentsDespite the COVID-19-related impact on vehicle production, OEMs are still looking to enhance current L2+ solutions by improving system fidelity, availability, and performance. High-definition maps with constant updates, global coverage, and various semantic features are prerequisites for L2+ applications and the future deployment of robotaxi and passenger car autonomy (Consumer AV). Canonical mapping methods rely on extensive manual labor and dedicated mapping vehicles. Mobileye's disruptive REM crowdsource mapping technology provides automatic map creation and updates. REM mapping capabilities are also being leveraged to extend the value of static and dynamic data to businesses in new market segments such as smart cities and infrastructure surveys.We believe the future of autonomous driving will unfold in two phases: commercial robotaxi and series-production passenger car consumer AVs. We expect consumer AVs to materialize only after the robotaxi industry deploys and matures. The main inhibitors of a mass market product offering of consumer AV are the cost of AV technology, ability to scale at a low cost, regulatory framework, and public acceptance. Thus, we see the robotaxi phase as a necessary corridor to consumer AV. Mobileye is well-positioned to play a significant role in the broader MaaS market with the commercialization of robotaxi and the future consumer AV market. Our full-stack self-driving system—geared with our camera-centric backbone and vast experience in productizing cutting-edge technology in the automotive industry—is the foundation for developing an economically competitive AV solution. Proliferation of data-collection vehicles alongside REM technology will allow for low-cost geographic expansion and coverage. Together with Moovit's complementary assets in the service layers, Mobileye is building itself as an end-to-end service provider at scale.Until the UNECE, EU, and U.S. provide regulation for self-driving vehicles without safety drivers for commercial ride sharing and public transportation, several countries are pushing to enact laws and regulation by 2021 to enable regular deployment and operation of MaaS fleets with self-driving vehicles starting in 2022. Products and CompetitivenessOur offering for ADAS and AV is propelled by our computer vision and AI expertise and software assets, deployed on our EyeQ SoC family. The tight co-design of hardware and software gives the EyeQ SoC the ability to support complex and computationally intense tasks and sets it apart from competition because it is purpose-fit for high-compute, low-power, automotive-compliant mission profiles. Our 5th Gen EyeQ5 SoC is designed to act as the central computer for fully autonomous driving vehicles. We have been able to achieve power, performance, and cost targets by employing proprietary computational cores that are optimized for a wide variety of computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning tasks, including deep neural networks. Starting with EyeQ5, we are supporting an automotive-grade standard operating system and providing a complete software development kit to allow customers to differentiate their solutions by deploying their algorithms on EyeQ5. The EyeQ5 SoC is expected to be in commercial vehicles starting in 2021 and is already operational in our autonomous test vehicles.EyeQ5 serves as the computational foundation for our scalable camera-only surround sensing system. The system consists of multiple independent computer vision engines and deep networks for algorithmic redundancy. The result is a robust and comprehensive model of the environment that allows end-to-end autonomous driving. The surround computer vision system is the backbone of Mobileye's AV architecture and the flagship offering for next-generation ADAS.The next significant building block in our complete offering is REM mapping technology, which compiles crowdsourced mapping data from EyeQ SoC-equipped vehicles. We are focused on our crowd-sourced mapping efforts and expect a significant increase in harvesting capabilities in 2021. We also expect an expansion of the number of vehicles using our localization capabilities by the end of 2021. The REM RoadbookTM can enhance current ADAS applications through a variety of advanced features, including predictive adaptive cruise control, lane-level localization in all weather and road conditions, hands-free driving application, and real-time alerts.Leveraging this data, we launched a full suite of vision-based data services for cities, road operators, transportation authorities, and mapping companies. Using vehicles equipped with Mobileye's road mapping technology, we provide highly refreshed geographic information systems data about the road network, infrastructure assets, pavement condition, mobility, and traffic. This information allows our customers to monitor and preserve their infrastructure more efficiently, making roadways and streets safer for all.The third building block in our full stack offering is our unique formal model for AV safety (RSS). At its core, RSS is a pragmatic method to design and then efficiently validate the safety of an AV, serving as the governing safety layer for the decision-making system. RSS formalizes human decision making for safe driving under two main principles: first, it acknowledges the need to balance safety with useful driving by making plausible worst-case scenario assumptions for other road users; and second, it provides a technology-neutral model and a transparent framework for the regulatory endeavor of building an industry standard for safety. In late 2019, Intel was named to lead the IEEE working group to develop AV decision making standards.These building blocks are already part of our recently launched Mobileye Supervision, a direct derivative of our autonomous driving program. This solution proves that there is a valuable use case for AV technology in the most advanced driver-assistance systems.MD&A26Table of ContentsFinancial PerformanceInternet of Things Revenue $BInternet of Things Op Income $B■ IOTG ■ MobileyeRevenue Summary2020 vs. 2019IOTG revenue decreased $814 million, or 21%, primarily driven by the economic impacts of COVID-19 with $470 million in lower ASPs driven by weaker core mix and $265 million driven by weaker demand for IOTG platform products.

Our data-centric businesses collectively grew 9% due to increased platform volume as cloud service providers increased capacity to serve customer demand. We also saw continued growth in DCG communications service providers, partially offset by enterprise and government decline. We saw growth in DCG adjacencies driven by 5G networking deployment and improved NAND pricing and higher demand in NAND, partially offset by weaker core mix and demand in IOTG platform products due to COVID-19. Our PC-centric business was up 8% year over year driven by strength in notebook and Wi-Fi sales. That growth was slightly offset by lower desktop volume and lower notebook ASPs resulting from higher demand for consumer and education PCs, and volume decline in LTE modem and connected home following the exit of those businesses.2019 vs. 2018In 2019, revenue was $72.0 billion, up $1.1 billion, or 2%, from 2018. Our data-centric businesses collectively grew 3% year over year and made up nearly half of our total revenue in 2019. Platform ASPs increased due to stronger core mix offset by a decline in NSG ASPs due to lower NAND market pricing and a decrease in DCG platform unit sales as the enterprise and government market segment contracted. Our PC-centric business was flat year over year as ASP strength from richer commercial segment mix and modem growth were offset by declines in platform volume. MD&A38Table of ContentsGross MarginWe derived most of our overall gross margin dollars from the sale of platform products in the DCG and CCG operating segments. Our overall gross margin dollars in 2020 increased by $1.5 billion, or approximately 3%, compared to 2019, and in 2019 decreased by $1.6 billion, or 4%, compared to 2018.

We recognized impairments of $290 million on non-marketable equity securities ($122 million in 2019 and $132 million in 2018). In 2018, we recognized an impairment charge of $290 million in our equity method investment in IMFT.

When assessing our sources of liquidity, we include cash and investments as shown in the preceding table. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade securities.Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of December 26, 2020, we had no commercial paper outstanding. During 2020, we issued a total of $10.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and repaid $1.0 billion of our 1.85% senior notes that matured in May 2020 and $1.8 billion of our 2.45% senior notes that matured in July 2020. We also repaid $700 million in floating-rate senior notes that matured in May 2020. Additionally, we paid $1.1 billion to satisfy conversion obligations for the remaining $372 million of our $2.0 billion 2009 Debentures. On March 24, 2020, we suspended the use of our financial resources for stock repurchases. On August 19, 2020, in response to our belief that our stock was trading well below its intrinsic valuation at that time, we entered into ASR agreements to repurchase an aggregate of $10.0 billion of our common stock. In total, we have repurchased approximately $17.6 billion in shares as part of our planned $20.0 billion share repurchases announced in October 2019. We intend to complete the remaining $2.4 billion balance of these planned repurchases in Q1 2021. We believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential acquisitions, strategic investments, dividends, and common stock repurchases.MD&A42Table of ContentsSources and Uses of Cash(In Millions)In summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Dec 29, 2018Net cash provided by operating activities$35,384 $33,145 $29,432 Net cash used for investing activities(20,796)(14,405)(11,239)Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities(12,917)(17,565)(18,607)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$1,671 $1,175 $(414)MD&A43Table of ContentsOperating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.For 2020 compared to 2019, the $2.2 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were driven by accounts receivable, inventory, and income taxes, offset by other assets and liabilities.For 2019 compared to 2018, the $3.7 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were driven by taxes, other assets and liabilities, and accounts receivable, offset by customer utilization of prepaid supply agreement payments and inventory build. Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals, and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were $14.3 billion in 2020, excluding NAND capital expenditures subsequent to the held for sale date ($16.2 billion in 2019 and $15.2 billion in 2018). The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in purchases of available-for-sale debt investments and trading assets, offset by an increase in maturities and sales of available-for-sale debt investments and trading assets, and a decrease in capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions.The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to net trading asset activity, acquisitions, and capital expenditures. The increase was partially offset by net available-for-sale debt investment activity.Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.The decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by long-term debt issuances, offset by an increase in repayments of debt and debt conversions and an increase in repurchases of common stock. During 2020, we repurchased $14.2 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, compared to $13.6 billion in 2019. As of December 26, 2020, $9.7 billion remained available for repurchasing common stock under the repurchase authorization limit. Our total dividend payments were $5.6 billion in 2020 compared to $5.6 billion in 2019. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 113 quarters. The decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to increased long-term debt issuance, offset by increased repurchases of common stock.

They were not recorded as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 26, 2020, as we had not yet received the related goods nor taken title to the property.3Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services. 4Tax obligations represent the future cash payments related to Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings. For further information, see \"Note 8: Income Taxes\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.5Amounts represent principal payments for all debt obligations and interest payments for fixed-rate debt obligations. Interest payments on floating-rate debt obligations, as well as the impact of fixed-rate to floating-rate debt swaps, are excluded.6Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Derivative instruments are excluded from the preceding table because they do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid.7Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as current liabilities, except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities.The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in \"Other purchase obligations and commitments\" in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.For the purchase of raw materials, we have entered into certain agreements that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table. Approximately half of our milestone-based contracts are tooling related for the purchase of capital equipment. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the counterparty. As of December 26, 2020, assuming that all future milestones are met, the additional required payments would be approximately $530 million.For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.MD&A45Table of ContentsQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange RatesWe are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt and equity instruments and loans receivable, and may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. We are exposed to currency exchange risks from our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt indebtedness and may use foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage this risk.Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies, primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, the Israeli shekel, and the Chinese yuan. We have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-U.S. dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards or option contracts in these hedging programs. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 10% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions outstanding as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, would result in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $61 million and less than $38 million, respectively.Interest RatesWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and the financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns. We also enter into swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into floating-rate coupon payments for our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.A hypothetical increase in benchmark interest rates of up to 1%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $75 million as of December 26, 2020 (a hypothetical decrease of 1% would have resulted in an increase of approximately $88 million as of December 28, 2019).Taking into account floating-rate debt and fixed-rate debt that is swapped to floating-rate debt, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of up to 1% would result in an increase in annual interest expense on our indebtedness of approximately $132 million from debt outstanding as of December 26, 2020 (an increase of approximately $139 million from debt outstanding as of December 28, 2019). Equity PricesWe are exposed to equity market risk through our investments in marketable equity securities, which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activities. As of December 26, 2020, the fair value of our marketable equity securities was $1.8 billion ($450 million as of December 28, 2019). Substantially all of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of December 26, 2020 was concentrated in securities traded on the Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity securities, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio. Assuming a decline of 60% in market prices, the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by approximately $1.1 billion, based on the value as of December 26, 2020 (a decrease in value of approximately $180 million, based on the value as of December 28, 2019 using an assumed decline of 40%). We utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities.MD&A46Table of ContentsMany of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $3.3 billion as of December 26, 2020 ($3.5 billion as of December 28, 2019) and included our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. of $658 million ($658 million as of December 28, 2019). The carrying amount of our equity method investments was $18 million as of December 26, 2020 ($37 million as of December 28, 2019). Commodity Price RiskAlthough we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities. MD&A47Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance.Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects where applicable. Income tax effects have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate for each adjustment. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.Non-GAAP adjustment or measureDefinition Usefulness to management and investorsAcquisition-related adjustmentsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and MG&A in our U.S. GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years.We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.Restructuring and other chargesRestructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges include asset impairments, pension charges, and costs associated with restructuring activity.We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our current operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.Gains (losses) from divestitureGains or losses are recognized at the close of a divestiture.We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because they do not reflect our current operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.Ongoing mark-to-market on marketable equity securitiesAfter the initial mark-to-market adjustment is recorded upon a security becoming marketable, gains and losses are recognized from ongoing mark-to-market adjustments of our marketable equity securities.We exclude these ongoing gains and losses for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we do not believe this volatility correlates to our core operational performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.Tax Reform We made adjustments to the original estimate of income tax expense resulting from Tax Reform.We exclude adjustments to the provisional tax estimate for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because they are the result of regulatory change and do not reflect our current operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.Free cash flowWe reference a non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow, which is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings. Free cash flow is operating cash flow adjusted to exclude additions to property, plant and equipment. We also reference a ratio of free cash flow to non-GAAP net income.This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in understanding our capital requirements and provides an additional means to evaluate the cash flow trends of our business. We excluded additions to held for sale NAND property, plant and equipment because the additions are not representative of our long-term capital requirements and we expect these assets to be sold. The ratio of free cash flow to non-GAAP net income is helpful in comparing the results and trends of our adjusted cash flow to income.MD&A48Table of ContentsFollowing are the reconciliations of our most comparable U.S. GAAP measures to our non-GAAP measures presented:Years Ended (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Dec 29, 2018Operating income$23,678 $22,035 $23,316 Acquisition-related adjustments1,416 1,324 1,305 Restructuring and other charges198 393 (72)Non-GAAP operating income$25,292 $23,752 $24,549 Operating margin30.4 %30.6 %32.9 %Acquisition-related adjustments1.8 %1.8 %1.8 %Restructuring and other charges0.3 %0.5 %(0.1)%Non-GAAP operating margin32.5 %33.0 %34.7 %Net income$20,899 $21,048 $21,053 Acquisition-related adjustments1,416 1,324 1,305 Restructuring and other charges198 393 (72)(Gains) losses from divestiture(6)(690)(494)Ongoing mark-to-market on marketable equity securities 133 (277)129 Tax Reform— — (294)Income tax effects(209)(14)(102)Non-GAAP net income$22,431 $21,784 $21,525 Earnings per share—diluted$4.94 $4.71 $4.48 Acquisition-related adjustments0.33 0.29 0.28 Restructuring and other charges0.05 0.09 (0.02)(Gains) losses from divestiture— (0.16)(0.11)Ongoing mark-to-market on marketable equity securities 0.03 (0.06)0.03 Tax Reform— — (0.06)Income tax effects(0.05)— (0.02)Non-GAAP earnings per share—diluted$5.30 $4.87 $4.58 Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Dec 29, 2018Dec 30, 2017Dec 31, 2016Net cash provided by operating activities$35,384 $33,145 $29,432 $22,110 $21,808 Additions to property, plant and equipment(14,259)(16,213)(15,181)(11,778)(9,625)Free cash flow$21,125 $16,932 $14,251 $10,332 $12,183 Net cash used for investing activities$(20,796)$(14,405)$(11,239)$(15,762)$(25,817)Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities$(12,917)$(17,565)$(18,607)$(8,475)$(5,739)MD&A49Table of ContentsOther Key InformationSelected Financial DataYears Ended (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Dec 29, 2018Dec 30, 2017Dec 31, 2016Net revenue$77,867 $71,965 $70,848 $62,761 $59,387 Gross margin1$43,612 $42,140 $43,737 $39,098 $36,233 Gross margin percentage156.0 %58.6 %61.7 %62.3 %61.0 %Research and development1$13,556 $13,362 $13,543 $13,035 $12,685 Marketing, general and administrative1$6,180 $6,350 $6,950 $7,629 $8,671 R&D and MG&A as a percentage of revenue125.3 %27.4 %28.9 %32.9 %36.0 %Operating income1$23,678 $22,035 $23,316 $18,050 $13,133 Net income2$20,899 $21,048 $21,053 $9,601 $10,316 Effective tax rate216.7 %12.5 %9.7 %52.8 %20.3 %Earnings per share2Basic$4.98 $4.77 $4.57 $2.04 $2.18 Diluted$4.94 $4.71 $4.48 $1.99 $2.12 Weighted average diluted shares of common stock outstanding4,232 4,473 4,701 4,835 4,875 Dividends per share of common stock, declared and paid$1.32 $1.26 $1.20 $1.0775 $1.04 Net cash provided by operating activities$35,384 $33,145 $29,432 $22,110 $21,808 Additions to property, plant and equipment$14,259 $16,213 $15,181 $11,778 $9,625 Repurchase of common stock$14,229 $13,576 $10,730 $3,615 $2,587 Payment of dividends to stockholders$5,568 $5,576 $5,541 $5,072 $4,925 (In Millions)Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Dec 29, 2018Dec 30, 2017Dec 31, 2016Property, plant and equipment, net$56,584 $55,386 $48,976 $41,109 $36,171 Total assets$153,091 $136,524 $127,963 $123,249 $113,327 Debt$36,401 $29,001 $26,359 $26,813 $25,283 Stockholders' equity$81,038 $77,504 $74,563 $69,019 $66,226 Employees (in thousands)110.6 110.8 107.4 102.7 106.0 1    In Q1 2018, we adopted \"Retirement Benefits—Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\" on a retrospective basis. As a result of the adoption of this standard, cost of sales, operating expenses, and interest and other, net for periods 2017 and 2016 in the preceding table have been restated. 2    In Q4 2017, we recognized a $5.4 billion higher income tax expense as a result of one-time impacts from Tax Reform. In 2018, our effective tax rate benefited from the reduction of the U.S. statutory federal tax rate. Other Key Information50Table of ContentsSales and MarketingCustomersWe sell our products primarily to OEMs, ODMs, and cloud service providers. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers, who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase Intel® processors and other products from our distributors. We have incentive programs that allow distributors to sell our microprocessors and other products in small quantities to systems integrators. Our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets.Sales ArrangementsOur products are sold through distribution channels throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. Because our customers generally order from us on a purchase order basis, they can typically cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.In accordance with contract terms, revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, 30 days after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor. DistributionDistributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.Seasonal TrendsHistorically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. Due to COVID-19 related impacts on demand in 2020, net revenue was higher in the first half of the year due to strong notebook platform demand driven by the increase in working and learning from home, and strength in data center demand as cloud service providers increased capacity. MarketingOur global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, differentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives preference with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Atom, Celeron, Pentium, and Intel Xeon trademarks make up our key CPU brands. This year, we added a new GPU brand, Intel Iris. We also introduced the Intel Evo platform brand for designs based on 11th Gen Intel Core processors.In 2020, we launched our new brand that signals our business transformation. We promote brand awareness and preference, and generate demand through our own direct marketing, as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press relations. We market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for our products. Our key messaging focuses on increased performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as connectivity.Other Key Information51Table of ContentsCertain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs. These cooperative advertising and marketing programs broaden the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Certain customers are licensed to place Intel® logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel® brands, subject to customers meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. We have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers.Intellectual Property Rights and Licensing Intel owns and develops significant IP and related IP rights around the world that relate to our products, services, R&D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress rights, and mask work rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. Such efforts can be difficult, however, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. For a discussion of the risks related to IP and our IP rights, see \"We are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings\" in \"Risk Factors\" within this section. While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.We have obtained patents in the U.S. and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, and the comparative pace of governments' patenting processes, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire; in some cases, our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted. As we expand our product offerings into new industries, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third parties. Established competitors in existing and new industries, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other IP, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all.The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our component-level and platform products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors' products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the judgment was made, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our Consolidated Financial Statements. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was made.Refer to \"Note 2: Accounting Policies\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates and policies, which are as follows:▪Inventories—the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory, excluding factory excess capacity costs. Inventory reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering future demand and market conditions; ▪Long-lived assets—the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment of property, plant and equipment, identified intangibles, and goodwill, including the determination of asset groupings and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units;▪Non-marketable equity investments—the valuation estimates and assessment of impairment and observable price adjustments; and▪Loss contingencies—the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.Other Key Information52Table of ContentsRisk FactorsThe following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including in the MD&A and Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.Changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results. Demand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our products varies within or among the market segments served by our PC-centric and data-centric businesses. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, we saw negative COVID-driven demand impacts in several areas of our business during the second half of 2020, as discussed in MD&A, and the nature and extent of future impacts are difficult to predict. Changes in the demand for our products, particularly our CCG and DCG platform products, can reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.Important factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:▪business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;▪consumer confidence or income levels, and the levels of customer capital spending, which may be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing, taxation, or spending policies; the credit market; expected inflation; employment; and energy or other commodity prices;▪our ability to timely introduce competitive products; ▪competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;▪the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;▪customer order patterns, including order cancellations, which can be affected by maturing product cycles for our products, customers' products, and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles; disruptions affecting customers; and other factors;▪market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing products, including the introduction and availability of products used together with our products; and▪customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user computing workloads.Due to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we are not always able to timely respond to fluctuations in demand and we may incur significant charges and costs. Because we own and operate high-tech fabrication facilities, our operations have high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to utilization of existing facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. Conversely, at times product demand increases or we fail to forecast accurately or produce the mix of products demanded, and we are unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough, or otherwise fail to meet market demand, which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships. We face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments; changes in industry standards; changes in customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent product introductions and improvements. When we do not anticipate and/or respond to these developments, our competitive position can weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has intensified, and we expect it to continue to do so in the future.Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by product and market segment. For example, our competitors have introduced data center and client platform products with performance improvements and additional processor core counts that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment. In our IOTG business, for example, interoperability, connectivity, safety, security, industrial use conditions, and long-life support are among the key competitive factors. To the extent our products do not meet our customers' requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape, our business and results of operation can be harmed.Other Key Information53Table of ContentsWe face intense competition across our product portfolio from companies offering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; accelerator products such as GPUs, including those offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity and networking products; and other semiconductor products. Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms, such as the ARM architecture, and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. For example, ARM-based products are being used in PCs and servers, which could lead to further development and growth of the ARM ecosystem. We also compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers. Some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads. For example, in 2020, Apple introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in place of our client CPUs.Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (TSMC) or Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and subcontractors for manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products. Manufacturing process improvements introduced by TSMC have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to increasingly competitive offerings by our competitors. As an IDM, we have higher capital expenditures and R&D spending than many of our \"fabless\" competitors. We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or business collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which could have a significant impact on our competitive position. For example, we could face increased competition as a result of China's programs to promote a domestic semiconductor industry and supply chains.Introduction of competitive new products and technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products, exert downward pricing pressure on our products, and adversely affect our business. For example, our DCG platform ASPs were impacted by the competitive pricing environment during 2020. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. For example, in 2020, NVIDIA announced an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings plc, and AMD announced an agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.If we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.We invest significantly in R&D, and to the extent our R&D efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position can be harmed and we may not realize a return on our investments. To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful R&D effort, develop new products and manufacturing processes, and improve our existing products and processes, all ahead of competitors. We are focusing our R&D efforts across several key areas: process and packaging technology, architecture, memory, interconnect, security, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. We cannot guarantee that all of these efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations, as discussed in the risk factor “We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology.” To the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we can face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages. In addition, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new product designs. To the extent our R&D efforts do not timely produce semiconductor designs for our platform products with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product.We do not expect all of our R&D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products fail, and the products and technologies we invest in and develop are not always well received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant investments in R&D, and our investments at times do not contribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. Our investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. In recent years, we have entered new areas and introduced new products as we seek to lead in key technology inflections such as AI, 5G networking, and the intelligent and autonomous edge. We have expanded our adjacent product offerings in client computing, the data center, the Internet of Things, and memory, with offerings such as discrete GPUs, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel Optane technology products. These efforts are not always successful. For example, in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for the business. Other Key Information54Table of ContentsThese new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our expanded TAM, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in some of these market segments, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes utilize technologies that are different from the ones that we develop and manufacture, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, performance, integration, time-to-market, and energy efficiency of our products, as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Some of these new businesses face challenging market conditions. For example, market pricing for NAND memory products has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.Changes in the mix of products sold can materially impact our financial results. Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our platform product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based on Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon processors. Our adjacent products also typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced platform products, and at times are not profitable. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platform products in any of our market segments, or our adjacent products represent an increasingly greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross margin percentage may decrease.We are vulnerable to product and manufacturing-related risks.We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing technologies. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the development of next-generation process technologies at increasingly advanced nodes as we seek to realize the benefits of Moore's Law. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes. We are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We  experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology. Although we began shipping products based on our 10nm process technology in volume in 2019, our delays in transitioning to this node occurred while third-party foundries such as TSMC developed new, competitive process technologies. Competitors using third-party foundries are able to benefit from the improvements such process technologies have made in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which has helped increase the competitiveness of their products. In 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our 7nm process technology that resulted in yield degradation, which was the primary driver for a delay in our expectations for our 7nm-based CPU product timing. These delays can allow competitors to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us by third-party foundries and could adversely affect the competitiveness of our products. Because of the delays in our 10nm and 7nm process technologies, we may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products. To increase our manufacturing and design flexibility, we have developed a disaggregated design approach for certain products, which enables us to manufacture processors and components on different process technologies, including third-party foundry processes, and connect them in a single package with advanced packaging technologies. This approach introduces additional risks as described in the risk factor “We face supply chain risks.” Our efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance of the process node introduction. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&D investments, particularly as development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses.Other Key Information55Table of ContentsRisks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, and product defects and errata. Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, including additional cores or other competitive features in our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs and adversely affect our gross margins, and can contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. When we introduce a new process node, it typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields. For example, our increased 10nm product mix in 2020 had a negative impact on our overall unit cost and gross margins, and yields on our 10nm manufacturing process remain below our mature 14nm process. In addition, the improvements we expect to make in 10nm costs and yields may not proceed at the same rate as the improvements we made on 14nm. As the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields.From time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, interruptions in our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations. In addition, delays in our product introductions can cause us to become less competitive and lose revenue opportunities, and our gross margin could be adversely affected because we incur significant costs up front in the product development stage and earn revenue to offset these costs over time.We face supply chain risks. Thousands of suppliers provide materials and equipment that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply. However, for certain materials and equipment, including certain photolithography tools, we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. In addition, supplier consolidation or business failures can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. Finding and qualifying alternate or additional suppliers is often a lengthy process and can lead to production delays or additional costs, and such alternatives are sometimes not available at all. The inability of suppliers to deliver necessary production materials or equipment can disrupt our production processes and make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Suppliers periodically extend lead times, face capacity constraints, limit supplies, increase prices, experience quality issues, or encounter cybersecurity or other issues that can interrupt or increase the cost of our supply. Our production can be disrupted by the unavailability of resources, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources at times requires us to reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our manufacturing operations and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by IP or other litigation between our suppliers, where an injunction against Intel or a supplier could interrupt the availability of goods or services supplied to Intel by others.We also rely on third-party providers to manufacture, assemble and test, and supply certain components and products, including for areas such as networking, communications, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory. We may utilize third-party providers for these and other components and products in the future. From time to time, these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely or cost-effective basis, in sufficient volumes, or at all. In some cases there are limited or no readily available satisfactory alternate providers. In any of these circumstances, we can encounter supply delays or disruptions or incur additional costs that could prevent us from meeting customer demand and/or adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, while we have a supply agreement with Micron providing for the supply of Intel 3D XPoint memory, we may need to fund and develop internal manufacturing options to continue 3D XPoint memory supply in the longer term. We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, manufacturing yields, quality, product quantities, and costs for components and products that are manufactured or supplied by third parties.Our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different components on different process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed, our costs could increase, and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected.Increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices could cause our compliance costs to increase or result in publicity that negatively affects our reputation. Moreover, given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do not directly control the procurement or employment practices of such suppliers, we could be subject to similar financial or reputational risks as a result of our suppliers' conduct.Other Key Information56Table of ContentsWe are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues. From time to time, we identify product defects, errata (deviations from published specifications), and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or attain through acquisitions, can also contain defects. Product issues can lead to product failures, unpredictable system behavior, system instability, and other issues, and sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third-party products and software. We also face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or applications, including transportation, autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses. Costs from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:▪writing off some or all of the value of inventory;▪recalling products that have been shipped;▪providing product replacements or modifications;▪providing consideration to customers, including reimbursement for certain costs they incur;▪defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and▪paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and/or result in delay or loss of revenue. Mitigation techniques designed to address product issues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis—or at all—and do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues for all applications, and can result in adverse performance or power effects. We and third parties, such as hardware and software vendors, may make prioritization decisions about which product issues to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation and result in costs. Product defects, errata, or other issues can damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases, result in legal liability, or make our products less competitive, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, our liability insurance coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products. We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products, as well as the operating systems and workloads that run on them and the components that interact with them. Components and IP we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard specifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. As we have become a more data-centric company, our processors and other products are being used in additional and new critical application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category known as side-channel vulnerabilities, such as the variants referred to as \"Spectre\" and \"Meltdown.\" Additional categories and variants have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified. Publicity about these and other security vulnerabilities has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities, including with respect to security and manageability features in our products. Vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become known. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a security vulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become aware of additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products, and address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.Mitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, are not always available on a timely basis—or at all—and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness, and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether and how to develop and deploy mitigations. We and such third parties may make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation. Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties.Other Key Information57Table of ContentsSecurity vulnerabilities and any limitations of, or adverse effects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For example, whether or not vulnerabilities involve attempted or successful exploits, they may result in our incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, providing product replacements or modifications, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. These effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are available, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation. We are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, and safety regulations. The manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations can result in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; suspension of production; alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales.Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements. Environmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Regulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements and increased compliance and energy costs. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations are subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.The COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected significant portions of our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to numerous pandemic-related risks, including those described below. The degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, other actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the virus and resulting economic disruption, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. We are similarly unable to predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other partners, and their financial conditions, but a material effect on these parties could also materially adversely affect us. Operational risks. The pandemic has resulted in authorities imposing, and businesses and individuals implementing, numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place/stay-at-home and social distancing orders, and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors, suppliers, and partners. We have significant manufacturing operations in the U.S., Ireland, Israel, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and is taking measures to try to contain it. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the business impacts from such measures and potential future measures. Shelter-in-place orders and other measures, including work-from-home and social distancing policies implemented to protect employees, have resulted in reduced workforce availability at some of our sites, construction delays, and reduced capacity at some of our vendors and suppliers. Restrictions on our manufacturing or support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers, can impact our ability to meet customer demand and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if prolonged. Similarly, current and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation can also impact our ability to meet demand and could materially adversely affect us. Our customers have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions in their operations and supply chains, which can result in delayed, reduced, or cancelled orders, or collection risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations. We previously paused new construction projects at several of our manufacturing sites due to local government restrictions. While these restrictions were subsequently lifted, similar restrictions affecting construction could be imposed again in the future.The pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices, including with respect to employee travel; employee work locations; cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events, and conferences; and social distancing measures. We may take further actions as required by government authorities or others, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, vendors, and partners. Work-from-home and other measures introduce additional operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, and have affected the way we conduct our product development, validation, and qualification, customer support, and other activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and illness and workforce disruptions could lead to unavailability of key personnel and harm our ability to perform critical functions.Other Key Information58Table of ContentsDemand and macroeconomic risks. The pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. It has caused a significant contraction in the global economy, and there is considerable uncertainty as to the severity and duration of the contraction. Risks related to adverse changes in global economic conditions are described in our risk factor titled “Global or regional conditions can harm our financial results,” and include the risk that demand for our products will be significantly harmed. During the second half of 2020 in particular, we saw negative COVID-related demand trends in several areas of our data-centric businesses, as well as COVID-related changes in product mix that drove lower ASPs in our PC-centric business, as discussed in MD&A. Given the continued and substantial economic uncertainty and volatility created by the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the nature and extent of impacts on demand for our products. For example, the increased demand for notebook products as a result of work- and learn-from-home dynamics may not continue as the pandemic progresses, or demand mix shifts that have been pronounced during the pandemic and have negatively impacted our ASPs could continue, such as the mix shift from desktop to notebook products in our CCG business and the mix shift from the enterprise and government market segment to the cloud service provider market segment in DCG.Liquidity risks. The pandemic has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. Unanticipated consequences of the pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future.Other risks. The impact of COVID-19 can also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Risk Factors section and throughout this report, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us. Developments related to COVID-19 have been unpredictable, and additional impacts and risks may arise that we are not aware of or able to respond to appropriately. We operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions.Global or regional conditions can harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the U.S. accounted for 79% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020, with revenue from billings to China, including Hong Kong, contributing 26% of our total revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control. Adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant contraction in the global economy, and there is considerable uncertainty as to its severity and duration. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including those related to the pandemic, can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.We can be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur, including:▪geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and terrorist activity, including, for example, geopolitical tensions and conflict affecting Israel, where our Mobileye business headquarters and certain of our fabrication facilities are located;▪natural disasters, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other catastrophic events;▪inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;▪formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and changes in the ability to obtain export licenses, which could be changed without notice;▪government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;▪adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives, including more favorable incentives provided to competitors;▪differing employment practices and labor issues;▪ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;▪local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;▪continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, including as a result of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union; and▪fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, which can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, interest rate changes, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors.Other Key Information59Table of ContentsWe are also subject to risks related to uncertainty regarding LIBOR. Certain of our interest rate derivatives and investments are based on LIBOR, and a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on LIBOR. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely after 2021 or to perform differently than in the past. While we expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be implemented prior to the 2021 target date or that the 2021 cessation date may be extended, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments, and they could include an increase in our interest expense and/or a reduction in our interest income.We are subject to risks related to trade policies and regulations. Trade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets. In particular, trade tensions between the U.S. and China have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to some of our products, and have affected customer ordering patterns. The U.S. has imposed restrictions on the export of U.S.-regulated products and technology to certain Chinese technology companies, including certain of our customers. These restrictions have reduced our sales, and continuing or future restrictions could adversely affect our financial performance, result in reputational harm to us due to our relationship with such companies, or lead such companies to develop or adopt technologies that compete with our products. It is difficult to predict what further trade-related actions governments may take, which may include trade restrictions and additional or increased tariffs and export controls imposed on short notice, and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to or mitigate such actions. Trade disputes and protectionist measures, or continued uncertainty about such matters, could result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us. Sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, and decoupling of global trade networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.Laws and regulations can have a negative impact on our business. We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. For example, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to 5G or autonomous driving technology may limit global adoption, impede our strategy, or negatively impact our long-term expectations for our investments in these areas. Expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and services, particularly in cloud, Internet of Things, and AI applications, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.We are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates can harm our results of operations and financial condition. Catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations and business, and those of our customers and suppliers, can be disrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic); cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, telecommunications, or IT systems providers; manufacturing equipment failures; or other catastrophic events. For example, we have at times experienced disruptions in our manufacturing processes as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, and disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, including due to cybersecurity incidents affecting our suppliers. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change can result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities located in semi-arid regions. During 2020, the west coast of the U.S. experienced historic wildfires, including in Oregon, where we have major manufacturing facilities. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear, but could be severe. Other Key Information60Table of ContentsCatastrophic events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. While we maintain business recovery plans, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from such disruptions. Furthermore, even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly, if our customers or suppliers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, we may experience reduced or cancelled orders or disruptions to our supply chain that may adversely affect our results of operations.We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability, cost, and decisions with respect to risk retention. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.Damage to our reputation can damage our business. Our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers, employees, governments, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Our failure to address, or the appearance of our failure to address, issues that give rise to reputational risk, including those described throughout this Risk Factors section, could significantly harm our reputation and our brands. Our reputation can be impacted by catastrophic events (including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic); incidents involving unethical behavior or misconduct; product quality, security, or safety issues; allegations of legal noncompliance; internal control failures; corporate governance issues; data breaches; workplace safety incidents; environmental incidents; the use of our products for illegal or objectionable applications, including AI and machine learning applications that present ethical, regulatory, or other issues; marketing practices; media statements; the conduct of our suppliers or representatives; and other issues or incidents that, whether actual or perceived, result in adverse publicity. To the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address corporate crises, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brands and could lead to increases in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions. Damage to our reputation could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business and operating environment. It could reduce investor confidence in us, adversely affecting our stock price. It may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employees. Moreover, repairing our reputation and brands may be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive.We are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks.We face risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet, or to introduce malicious software, to our IT systems. Individuals or organizations, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored organizations, insider threats including employees and third-party service providers, or intruders into our physical facilities, at times attempt to gain unauthorized access and/or corrupt the processes used to design and manufacture our hardware products and our associated software and services. Due to the widespread use of our products, we are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our suppliers, customers, or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, suppliers, and customers; interrupt our systems and services or those of our suppliers, customers, or others; or demand ransom to return control of such systems and services. Such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication, and if successful, expose us and the affected parties to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations, including our manufacturing operations. Our IT infrastructure also includes products and services provided by third parties, and these providers can experience breaches of their systems and products that impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or confidential information.From time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure, as well as those of third parties who provide products and services to us. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, our Habana Labs subsidiary’s network was breached, resulting in unauthorized third-party access of certain confidential information, in connection with a suspected unsuccessful ransomware attack. The breach was confined to our subsidiary’s network and is not expected to have a material impact on Habana Labs’ business. We are also subject to risks associated with attacks involving our supply chain. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we became aware of reports that an update to widely used IT infrastructure management software provided by one of our vendors, SolarWinds Corporation, had been compromised by attackers, and we are investigating these reports. To date, cybersecurity incidents have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations, but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, writing down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain the business relationship, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties, as well as reputational harm. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work and remote access to our systems has increased significantly, which also increases our cybersecurity attack surface. We have also seen an increase in cyberattack volume, frequency, and sophistication driven by the global enablement of remote workforces. We seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and changes or updates to our products and services; however, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. In some instances, we, our suppliers, our customers, and the users of our products and services can be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.Other Key Information61Table of ContentsTheft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. We anticipate that our collection of such personal data will increase as we enter into the MaaS market in our Mobileye business, and it may increase as we enter into other new or adjacent businesses. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant, and noncompliance could expose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and even criminal sanctions. Even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data-protection laws and regulations could result in audits, regulatory inquiries, or proceedings against us by governmental entities or other third parties.We are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We cannot always enforce or protect our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. We are not always able to enforce or protect our IP rights. Enforcement is costly and time-consuming and can divert management attention. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. From time to time, governments adopt regulations—and governments or courts render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and business. In some cases, our IP rights can offer inadequate protection for our innovations. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product development, and marketing could be reduced. This risk is heightened as competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees.Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to some of our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.Third parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business. We face claims based on IP rights from individuals and companies, including claims from those who have aggregated patents acquired from multiple sources to form a new, larger portfolio to assert claims against us and other companies. Some of these claimants are funded by investment firms and have substantial resources, which can increase our defense costs. Additionally, large patent portfolio owners sometimes divest portions of their portfolios to more than one individual or company, increasing the number of parties who own IP rights previously all held by a single party. We are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets, confidential information, or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers' businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.As a result of IP rights claims, we could:▪pay monetary damages, including payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, or royalties;▪stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;    ▪need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or▪enter into settlement or license agreements, which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.Other Key Information62Table of ContentsWe rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of our products include third-party technology or implement industry standards and may require licenses from third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party technology, or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. To the extent our products include software that contains or is derived from open-source software, we may be required to make the software's source code publicly available and/or license the software under open-source licensing terms.We are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory matters. From time to time, we face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, commercial, IP, and other issues on a global basis. As described in \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, harmful to our reputation, and distracting to management.We must attract, retain, and motivate key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business. The competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is increasingly intense. Competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees. In addition, changes in immigration policies may further limit the pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. Changes in the interpretation and application of employment-related laws to our workforce practices may also result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. Our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. If our share-based or other compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees would be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Moreover, sustained declines in our stock price can reduce the retention value of our share-based awards. Changes in our management team can also disrupt our business. For example, we underwent several significant changes to our technical leadership during 2020 and announced the appointment of a new CEO in January 2021. The failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employees, including in connection with these changes, could adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent we do not effectively hire, onboard, retain, and motivate key employees, our business can be harmed.We are subject to risks associated with our strategic transactions.Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and adversely impact our results of operations. Strategic transactions are an important component of our financial capital allocation strategy. We routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:▪our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;▪failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and of its anticipated benefits to materialize;▪disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management's attention;▪failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, if at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals at all or without materially burdensome conditions, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or other unforeseen factors;▪our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, and restructuring charges;▪our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses;▪our inability to retain key personnel of acquired businesses or our difficulty in integrating employees, business systems, and technology;▪controls, processes, and procedures of acquired businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to identify compliance issues or liabilities;▪our failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets; and▪the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt.Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions. Moreover, our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we at times need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives. Other Key Information63Table of ContentsWhere an existing investment does not meet our criteria for success, we routinely evaluate opportunities for possible divestitures and other options. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of divestitures, such as the pending divestiture of our NAND memory business to SK hynix, due to risks that include unfavorable prices and terms; changes in market conditions or geopolitical conditions affecting the regions or industries in which we or counterparties operate; failure to receive regulatory or governmental approvals; limitations or restrictions due to regulatory or governmental approvals, litigation, contractual terms, or other conditions; delays in closing; lack of support by third parties; actions by competitors; adverse effects on our business relationships, operating results, or business due to the announcement and pendency of such transactions; and continued financial obligations, unanticipated liabilities, or transition costs associated with such transactions. In some cases, we are not able to divest investments on acceptable terms or at all.We invest in public and private companies and do not always realize a return on our investments. We make investments in public and private companies around the world to further our strategic and financial objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. Companies in which we invest range from early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return in a timely fashion, if at all. Our ability to realize a return on our investment in a private company, if any, is typically dependent on the company participating in a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, which can include failures to achieve business objectives as well as bankruptcy, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment.We are subject to sales-related risks. We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs and ODMs. We depend on many distributors to help us create end-customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. At times, we rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products is limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products is not always easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties sell products that compete with our products, and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. From time to time, they face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.From time to time, our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized \"gray market.\" Gray market products can distort demand and pricing dynamics in our distribution channel and certain geographies, which at times adversely affects our revenue opportunities. Gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more challenging. Gray market products also sometimes include parts that have been altered or damaged, and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to be substandard.We receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Collectively, our three largest customers accounted for 39% of our net revenue in 2020 and 41% of our net revenue in 2019. We expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future.Industry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increased the significance and purchasing power of certain customers, particularly cloud service providers, in some of our data-centric businesses. The cloud and cloud applications represent a new and increasingly demanding computing environment. The further consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and applications; product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product security and security features. We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, and to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors, our competitive position and market segment share may be adversely affected. Some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including designs customized for their specific computing workloads. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely affected, and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise and government market segment customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads. During the second half of 2020, the mix shift in sales from enterprise and government market segment customers to cloud service providers contributed to lower ASPs in DCG. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud customer specifications, order changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs. The loss of, or substantial reduction in sales to, one of our key customers, or their delays in orders for our products, can lead to a reduction in our revenue and harm our results of operations and financial condition. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Key Information64Table of ContentsWe face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign government entities associated with grants, incentives, and sales of our products and services. Government demand and payment are often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including, with respect to U.S. government contracts, congressional approval of appropriations. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, U.S. government contracts are subject to special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, and security, and failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or debarment from future business with the U.S. government.Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.A number of factors can increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:    ▪changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;▪the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;▪changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;▪adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;▪increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;▪changes in available tax credits;▪changes in our ability to secure new, or renew existing, tax holidays and incentives;▪changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-U.S. income and expenses and changes resulting from the adoption by countries of OECD recommendations or other legislative actions;▪changes in accounting standards; and▪our decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.We have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases. We are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program, and the amount, timing, and execution of our repurchases fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments. Changes in cash flows, tax laws and other laws, and the market price of our common stock can also limit or alter the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases. Our stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time. For example, we suspended stock repurchases during a portion of 2020 due to uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value.PropertiesAs of December 26, 2020, our major facilities consisted of:(Square Feet in Millions)UnitedStatesOtherCountriesTotalOwned facilities31 23 54 Leased facilities1 5 6 Total facilities32 28 60 Our principal executive offices are located in the U.S. For more information on our wafer fabrication and our assembly and test facilities, see \"Manufacturing Capital\" within Fundamentals of Our Business.The facilities described above are suitable for our present purposes, and the productive capacity in our facilities is being utilized or being prepared for utilization as we continue to make investments to expand our manufacturing capacity.We do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, as they are interchangeable in nature and used by multiple operating segments.

In March 2020, we suspended stock repurchases in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2020, we entered into ASR agreements to repurchase $10.0 billion of our common stock and these agreements were settled in December 2020. As of December 26, 2020, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of which $9.7 billion remained available.Common stock repurchase activity under our publicly announced stock repurchase program during each quarter of 2020 was as follows:PeriodTotal Number ofShares Purchased(In Millions)Average PricePaid Per ShareDollar Value ofShares That MayYet Be Purchased Under the Program(In Millions)December 29, 2019 - March 28, 202071.4 $57.60 $19,658 March 29, 2020 - June 27, 2020— $— $19,658 June 28, 2020 - September 26, 2020Accelerated Share Repurchases1165.5 $49.20 $9,658 September 27, 2020 - December 26, 2020Accelerated Share Repurchases137.7 $49.20 $9,658 Total274.6 Common stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase program during Q4 2020 was as follows:PeriodTotal Number ofShares Purchased(In Millions)Average PricePaid Per ShareDollar Value ofShares That MayYet Be Purchased Under the Program(In Millions)September 27, 2020 - October 24, 2020— $— $9,658 October 25, 2020 - November 21, 2020— $— $9,658 November 22, 2020 - December 26, 2020Accelerated Share Repurchases137.7 $49.20 $9,658 Total37.7 1     In August 2020, we entered into ASR agreements with financial institutions under which we paid an aggregate of $10.0 billion and received an aggregate initial share delivery of 165.5 million shares of our common stock, which were immediately retired. We received and immediately retired an additional 37.7 million shares upon settlement of the ASR agreements in December 2020. In total, 203.2 million shares were repurchased under the ASR agreements at an average repurchase price per share of $49.20.We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program and are excluded from the preceding table.

In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 21, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Auditor's Reports71Table of ContentsInventory ValuationDescription of the MatterThe Company's net inventory totaled $8.4 billion as of December 26, 2020, representing 5.5% of total assets. As explained in \"Note 2: Accounting Policies\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company computes inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and applies judgment in determining saleability of products and the valuation of inventories. The Company assesses inventory at each reporting date in order to assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the products have achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers; the determination of normal capacity levels in its manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory; whether the product is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of saleable quality. Auditing management’s assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the determination of lower of cost or net realizable value and excess and obsolete inventory reserves is judgmental and considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as customer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand. Additionally, for certain new product launches there is limited historical data with which to evaluate forecasts.How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over the costing of inventory, the determination of whether inventory is of saleable quality, the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value reserves including related estimated costs and selling prices, and the determination of demand forecasts and related application against on hand inventory.Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions (e.g., estimated product costs and selling prices, and product demand forecasts) and the underlying data used in management’s inventory valuation assessment. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends. We assessed whether there were any potential sources of contrary information, including historical forecast accuracy or history of significant revisions to previously recorded inventory valuation adjustments, and performed sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in inventory valuation that would result from changes in the assumptions. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP        We have served as the Company's auditor since 1968.San Jose, CaliforniaJanuary 21, 2021 Auditor's Reports72Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel CorporationOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited Intel Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intel Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and our report dated January 21, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP                        San Jose, CaliforniaJanuary 21, 2021Auditor's Reports73Table of Contents Consolidated Statements of

StatementsConsolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity78Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 : Basis of PresentationWe have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 were 52-week fiscal years. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Intel and our subsidiaries. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19 on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates.Note 2 : Accounting PoliciesRevenue RecognitionWe recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or services to customers. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sales. In accordance with contract terms, revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed upon shipping terms. We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Variable consideration is estimated and reflected as an adjustment to the transaction price. We determine variable consideration, which consists primarily of various sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. Sales rebates earned by customers are offset against their receivable balances. Rebates earned by customers when they do not have outstanding receivable balances are recorded within other accrued liabilities.We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs for marketing activities for some of our products. We generally record the payment as a reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned, unless the payment is for a distinct service, which we record as expense when the marketing activities occur.InventoriesWe compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities and associated costs change in nature from R&D to cost of sales, and when cost of sales can be capitalized as inventory. For a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as PRQ. We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. A single PRQ has previously valued inventory up to $870 million in the quarter the PRQ milestone was achieved. Prior to PRQ, costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost of sales in the period incurred.The valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities. We apply our historical loadings compared to our total available capacity in a statistical model to determine our normal capacity level. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges are insignificant in the years presented. Charges in years prior to those presented have ranged up to $1.1 billion taken in connection with the 2009 economic recession.Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle, variations in market pricing, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. Lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserves fluctuate as we ramp new process technologies with costs improving over time due to scale and improved yields. Additionally, inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical changes in market conditions and the associated pricing environment. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements79Table of ContentsThe valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of salable quality. We use the demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we write off amounts considered to be excess inventory. Property, Plant and EquipmentWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment.We evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant and equipment, considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives.Assets are \"grouped\" and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. Fair ValueWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, grants receivable, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: ▪Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.▪Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use LIBOR-based yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.▪Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.Debt InvestmentsWe consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can include investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements.Marketable debt investments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements80Table of ContentsMarketable debt investments are considered available-for-sale investments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criteria for designation as trading assets are not met. Available-for-sale debt investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalents. Available-for-sale debt investments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Available-for-sale debt investments with remaining maturities beyond one year are classified as other long-term investments. Available-for-sale debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level, and record the interest income and realized gains or losses on the sale of these investments in interest and other, net.Our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews. For investments in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists by considering information about the collectability of the instrument, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. We recognize an allowance for credit losses, up to the amount of the unrealized loss when appropriate, and write down the amortized cost basis of the investment if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in interest and other, net, and unrealized losses not related to credit losses are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).Equity InvestmentsWe regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows: ▪Marketable equity securities are equity securities with RDFV that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement. ▪Non-marketable equity securities are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes.▪Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss. Our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investments is recognized on a one-quarter lag.Realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted for qualifying observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates. Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investee's fair value. Qualitative factors considered include the investee's financial condition and business outlook, industry and sector performance, market for technology, operational and financing cash flow activities, and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches, which require judgment and the use of estimates, including discount rates, investee revenue and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. ▪Non-marketable equity securities are tested for impairment using a qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and long-lived assets. Upon determining that an impairment may exist, the security's fair value is calculated and compared to its carrying value and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.▪Equity method investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews using the other-than-temporary impairment model, which considers the severity and duration of a decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery. Impairments of equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements81Table of ContentsDerivative Financial InstrumentsOur primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk, commodity price risk, and credit risk. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. For presentation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments, including related collateral amounts, are presented at fair value on a gross basis and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities.Cash flow hedges use foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards and currency interest rate swaps, to hedge exposures for variability in the U.S.-dollar equivalent of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital purchases spending.The after-tax gains or losses from the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the impact of the hedge transaction. For foreign currency contracts hedging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, and are recognized in earnings in the same income statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the cash flow hedge transactions become improbable, the corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be immediately reclassified to interest and other, net. These derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item.Fair value hedges use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the offsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other, net. These derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within cash flows from financing activities.Non-designated hedges use foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as trading assets, and non-U.S.-dollar-denominated loans receivables recognized at fair value. We also use interest rate contracts to hedge interest rate risk related to our U.S.-dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt instruments classified as trading assets. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded through earnings in the line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income to which the derivatives most closely relate, primarily in interest and other, net. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives. Loans ReceivableWe elect the fair value option when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at the inception of the loan with a related derivative instrument. When the fair value option is not elected, the loans are carried at amortized cost. We measure interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method, which is based on the effective yield of the loans rather than the stated coupon rate. We classify our loans within other current and long-term assets. Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, loans receivable, reverse repurchase agreements, and trade receivables. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty's relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy, substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December 26, 2020, our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding money market funds invested in U.S. treasury and U.S. agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed $2.0 billion. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our derivative counterparties and obtain and secure collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions when we deem it appropriate. Cash collateral exchanged under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. For reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability unless the collateral is repledged. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements82Table of ContentsA substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to OEMs and ODMs. We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. We believe the net accounts receivable balances from our three largest customers (43% as of December 26, 2020) do not represent a significant credit risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience. We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments in determining the fair value of the following:▪intangible assets, including the valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, and our assumed market segment share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;▪deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date; ▪inventory; property, plant and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; deferred revenue; and contingent consideration, each as may be applicable; and▪goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies. We allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination.GoodwillWe perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. The reporting unit's carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. Additionally, as part of this assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value.Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. Significant estimates include market segment growth rates, our assumed market segment share, estimated costs, and discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital.We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. In the current year, the fair value for all of our reporting units substantially exceeds their carrying value, and our annual qualitative assessment did not indicate that a more detailed quantitative analysis was necessary. Identified Intangible AssetsWe amortize acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life. Acquisition-related in-process R&D assets represent the fair value of incomplete R&D projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition; initially, these are classified as in-process R&D and are not subject to amortization. Once these R&D projects are completed, the asset balances are transferred from in-process R&D to acquisition-related developed technology and are subject to amortization from this point forward. The asset balances relating to projects that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to R&D.We perform a quarterly review of significant finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. These reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Employee Equity Incentive PlansWe use the straight-line amortization method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the service period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of RSUs, we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements83Table of ContentsIncome TaxesWe compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is affected by management's plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, such changes could also affect our future provision for taxes.We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income.We recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income as a period cost. We have recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-U.S. earnings or for outside basis differences in our subsidiaries, because we do not plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis differences. Remittances of non-U.S. earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-U.S. and U.S. operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-U.S. earnings, which could be subject to applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes. LeasesLeases primarily consist of real property, and, to a lesser extent, certain machinery and equipment. Our lease terms may include options to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and the non-lease components are accounted for separately and not included in our leased assets and corresponding liabilities. Payments on leases may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are based on output of the underlying leased assets.Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims, liabilities related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.Note 3 : Operating SegmentsWe manage our business through the following operating segments:▪DCG▪IOTG▪Mobileye▪NSG▪PSG▪CCGWe derive a substantial majority of our revenue from platform products, which are our principal products and considered as one class of product. We offer platform products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, based on Intel architecture. Platform products are used in various form factors across our DCG, IOTG, and CCG operating segments. Our non-platform, or adjacent, products can be combined with platform products to form comprehensive platform solutions to meet customer needs.DCG and CCG are our reportable operating segments. IOTG, Mobileye, NSG, and PSG do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. Our Internet of Things portfolio, presented as Internet of Things, is comprised of the IOTG and Mobileye operating segments. Beginning with the first quarter of 2021, we expect our DCG operating segment to include the results of our Intel Optane memory business, and our NSG segment will be composed of our NAND memory business.We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements84Table of ContentsWe have an \"all other\" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:▪results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented; ▪historical results of operations from divested businesses; ▪results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business; ▪amounts included within restructuring and other charges; ▪a portion of employee benefits, compensation, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and ▪acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.Net revenue and operating income (loss) for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Dec 29, 2018Net revenue:Data Center GroupPlatform$23,056 $21,441 $21,155 Adjacent3,047 2,040 1,836 26,103 23,481 22,991 Internet of Things IOTG3,007 3,821 3,455 Mobileye967 879 698 3,974 4,700 4,153 Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group5,358 4,362 4,307 Programmable Solutions Group1,853 1,987 2,123 Client Computing GroupPlatform35,642 32,681 33,234 Adjacent4,415 4,465 3,770 40,057 37,146 37,004 All other522 289 270 Total net revenue$77,867 $71,965 $70,848 Operating income (loss):Data Center Group$10,571 $10,227 $11,476 Internet of ThingsIOTG497 1,097 980 Mobileye241 245 143 738 1,342 1,123 Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group361 (1,176)(5)Programmable Solutions Group260 318 466 Client Computing Group15,129 15,202 14,222 All other(3,381)(3,878)(3,966)Total operating income$23,678 $22,035 $23,316  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements85Table of ContentsDisaggregated net revenue for each period was as follows:Years Ended (In Millions)Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Dec 29, 2018Platform revenueDCG platform$23,056 $21,441 $21,155 IOTG platform2,705 3,440 3,065 CCG desktop platform10,692 11,822 12,220 CCG notebook platform24,903 20,779 20,930 CCG other platform147 80 84 61,403 57,562 57,454 Adjacent revenue216,464 14,403 13,394 Total revenue$77,867 $71,965 $70,848 1    Includes our tablet and service provider revenue.2    Includes all of our non-platform products for DCG, IOTG, and CCG, such as modem, Ethernet, and silicon photonics, as well as Mobileye, NSG, and PSG products.In 2020, our three largest customers accounted for 39% of our net revenue (41% in 2019 and 39% in 2018), with Dell Inc. accounting for 17% (17% in 2019 and 16% in 2018), Lenovo Group Limited accounting for 12% (13% in 2019 and 12% in 2018), and HP Inc. accounting for 10% (11% in 2019 and 11% in 2018). These three customers accounted for 43% of our accounts receivable as of December 26, 2020 (39% as of December 28, 2019).

In January 2020, we fully redeemed the remaining principal of our 2009 Debentures. We included our 2009 Debentures in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of common stock in 2019 and 2018 by applying the treasury stock method because the average market price was above the conversion price.Securities that would have been anti-dilutive are insignificant and are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in all periods presented. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements86Table of ContentsNote 5 : Contract Liabilities(In Millions)Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Prepaid supply agreements$1,625 $1,805 Other250 236 Total contract liabilities$1,875 $2,041 Contract liabilities are primarily related to prepayments received from customers on long-term prepaid supply agreements toward future NSG product delivery.

The statutory tax rates in these jurisdictions range from 12.5% to 25.0%.

Most of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining non-U.S. and U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2040. A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year. The non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards include $772 million that is not likely to be recovered and has been reduced by a valuation allowance.At December 26, 2020, we have undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $19.0 billion that we have indefinitely invested, and on which we have not recognized deferred taxes. Estimating the amount of potential tax is not practicable because of the complexity and variety of assumptions necessary to compute the tax.Current income taxes receivable of $131 million as of December 26, 2020 ($76 million as of December 28, 2019) are included in other current assets. Current income taxes payable of $756 million as of December 26, 2020 ($575 million as of December 28, 2019) are included in other accrued liabilities. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements90Table of ContentsLong-term income taxes payable of $4.6 billion as of December 26, 2020 ($4.9 billion as of December 28, 2019) is primarily comprised of the transition tax from Tax Reform, which is payable over eight years beginning in 2018, as well as amounts for uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated deduction for state taxes and non-U.S. tax credits.Uncertain Tax Positions(In Millions)Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Dec 29, 2018Beginning gross unrecognized tax benefits$548 $283 $211 Settlements and effective settlements with tax authorities (142)(4)(7)Changes in balances related to tax position taken during prior periods165122(11)Changes in balances related to tax position taken during current period25714790Ending gross unrecognized tax benefits$828 $548 $283 If the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $550 million as of December 26, 2020 ($454 million as of December 28, 2019) and a reduction in the effective tax rate. Interest, penalties, and accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in the periods presented.We comply with the tax laws, regulations, and filing requirements of all jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain U.S. federal and non-U.S. tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 26, 2020 could decrease by as much as $430 million in the next 12 months. We file federal, state, and non-U.S. tax returns. Excluding pre-acquisition Altera tax years, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal and non-U.S. tax examinations for years prior to 2010. For U.S. state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2012.Note 9 : InvestmentsDebt InvestmentsTrading AssetsNet gains related to trading assets still held at the reporting date were $694 million in 2020 (net gains of $26 million in 2019 and net losses of $188 million in 2018). Net losses on the related derivatives were $667 million in 2020 (net gains of $22 million in 2019 and net gains of $163 million in 2018).Available-for-Sale Debt InvestmentsAvailable-for-sale investments include corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. Government debt includes instruments such as non-U.S. government bonds and U.S. agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, substantially all time deposits were issued by institutions outside the U.S. The adjusted cost of our available-for-sale investments was $7.8 billion as of December 26, 2020 and $6.5 billion as of December 28, 2019.

(Micron) and Intel to jointly develop NAND and 3D XPoint technology products. We owned a 49% interest in the entity. Upon Micron's notice of intent to exercise its right to call our interest in IMFT, we recognized an impairment charge of $290 million related to our investment in the third quarter of 2018. In 2019, Micron exercised its right and we sold our non-controlling interest in IMFT to Micron. We received $1.7 billion in sales proceeds and certain other repayments from Micron during 2019 and reported a gain of $107 million. We continue to purchase products manufactured by Micron at the IMFT facility under our supply agreement, which includes the next generation of 3D XPoint technology.McAfeeMcAfee completed its initial public offering in October 2020. Due to our 40% ownership and significant influence as of December 26, 2020, we account for it as an equity method investment. We had no accounting carrying value as of December 26, 2020 and as of December 28, 2019. During 2020, we received $126 million in dividends ($632 million in 2019). Note 10 : Acquisitions and DivestituresAcquisitionsWe completed six acquisitions in 2020 and five acquisitions in 2019, all of which qualified as business combinations. The consideration for the acquisitions in 2020 and 2019 primarily consisted of cash and was allocated to goodwill and identified intangible assets. For information on the assignment of goodwill to our operating segments, see \"Note 11: Goodwill,\" and for information on the classification of intangible assets, see \"Note 12: Identified Intangible Assets.\" Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements92Table of ContentsMoovitOn May 4, 2020, we acquired Moovit, a MaaS solutions company, for total consideration of $915 million. The fair values of the assets acquired relate to goodwill of $638 million and intangible assets of $331 million. The goodwill arising from the acquisition is attributed to the expected synergies and other benefits that will be generated from the combination of Intel and Moovit. We expect substantially all of the goodwill will not be deductible for local tax purposes. The acquisition-related intangible assets are primarily related to Moovit's monthly active user base and application platform. The goodwill and operating results of Moovit are included in our Mobileye operating segment.Habana LabsOn December 12, 2019, we acquired Habana Labs, an Israel-based developer of programmable deep learning accelerators targeting AI workloads in the data center, for total consideration of $1.7 billion. Habana Labs strengthens our AI portfolio and accelerates our efforts to capitalize on the nascent, fast-growing AI silicon market opportunity. The fair values of the assets acquired relate to goodwill of $1.5 billion and acquisition-related intangible assets of $250 million. The goodwill arising from the acquisition is attributed to the expected synergies and other benefits that will be generated from the combination of Intel and Habana Labs. We expect substantially all of the goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes. The acquisition-related intangible assets are primarily related to in-process R&D. The goodwill and operating results of Habana Labs are included in our DCG operating segment.DivestituresNAND Memory BusinessOn October 19, 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix Inc. (SK hynix) to divest our NAND memory business, including our NAND memory fabrication facility in Dalian, China and certain related equipment and tangible assets (the Fab Assets), our NAND SSD business (the NAND SSD Business), and our NAND memory technology and manufacturing business (the NAND OpCo Business). Our Intel Optane memory business is expressly excluded from the transaction. The transaction will occur over two closings for total consideration of $9.0 billion in cash, of which $7.0 billion will be received upon initial closing, not to occur prior to November 1, 2021, and the remaining $2.0 billion will be received no earlier than March 2025. The consummations of the first closing and the second closing are subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of certain governmental approvals.At the first closing, Intel will sell to SK hynix the Fab Assets and the NAND SSD Business, and SK hynix will assume from Intel certain liabilities related to the Fab Assets and the NAND SSD Business. In connection with the first closing, we and certain affiliates of SK hynix will also enter into a NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement pursuant to which we will manufacture and sell to SK hynix NAND memory wafers to be manufactured using the Fab Assets in Dalian, China, until the second closing.We will transfer certain employees, IP, and other assets related to the NAND OpCo Business to separately created, wholly owned subsidiaries of Intel at the first closing. The equity interest of these wholly owned subsidiaries will transfer to SK hynix at the second closing. We have concluded based on the terms of the transaction agreements that the subsidiaries will be variable interest entities for which we are not the primary beneficiary, and accordingly will deconsolidate at the first closing. The carrying amounts of the major classes of NAND assets held for sale included the following:(In Millions)Dec 26, 2020Inventories$962 Property, plant and equipment, net4,363 Total assets held for sale$5,325 We ceased recording depreciation on property, plant and equipment as of the date the assets triggered held for sale accounting.

Net proceeds from the offerings are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include refinancing outstanding debt, funding for working capital and capital expenditures, and repurchasing shares of our common stock. During 2020, we repaid $1.0 billion of our 1.85% senior notes that matured in May 2020 and $1.8 billion of our 2.45% senior notes that matured in July 2020. We also repaid $700 million in floating-rate senior notes that matured in May 2020.In 2019, we issued a total of $2.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and redeemed our $915 million, 4.70% senior notes due December 2045.Our floating-rate senior notes pay interest quarterly and our fixed-rate senior notes pay interest semiannually. We may redeem the fixed-rate notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified redemption prices and subject to certain restrictions. The obligations under the notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.Oregon and Arizona BondsIn 2019, we received proceeds of $648 million in aggregate from the sale of the 2019 Arizona Bonds and the 2019 Oregon Bonds. The bonds are our unsecured general obligations in accordance with loan agreements we entered into with the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona and the State of Oregon Business Development Commission. The bonds mature in 2049 and carry an interest rate of 5.00%. The 2019 Arizona Bonds and the 2019 Oregon Bonds are subject to mandatory tender in June 2024 and March 2022, respectively, at which time we can re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period or as variable-rate bonds until another fixed-rate period is selected or until their final maturity date.Convertible DebenturesIn 2009, we issued the 2009 Debentures, which were convertible, subject to certain conditions, into shares of our common stock and paid a fixed rate of interest semiannually. In 2019, we paid $1.5 billion to satisfy conversion obligations for $615 million in principal, resulting in a cumulative loss of $156 million in interest and other, net, and $1.0 billion as a reduction in stockholders' equity related to the conversion feature. In 2020, we paid $1.1 billion in cash to settle our remaining $372 million in principal, resulting in a loss of $109 million in interest and other, net and $750 million as a reduction in stockholders' equity related to the conversion feature.

If an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized on our non-marketable equity securities during the period, we classify these assets as Level 3. We classify non-marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity method investments as Level 3. Impairments recognized on these investments held as of December 26, 2020 were $272 million ($113 million held as of December 28, 2019 and $416 million held as of December 29, 2018).Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisFinancial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments that have not been remeasured or impaired in the current period, grants receivable, reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months, and issued debt. We classify the fair value of grants receivables as Level 2. The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying value. The aggregate carrying value of grants receivable as of December 26, 2020 was $139 million (the aggregate carrying value of grants receivable and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months as of December 28, 2019 was $543 million).We classify the fair value of issued debt (excluding commercial paper and drafts payable) as Level 2. The fair value of these instruments was $40.9 billion as of December 26, 2020 ($30.6 billion as of December 28, 2019).

The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. For the benefit of eligible U.S. employees, we also provide an unfunded non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees. We expensed $398 million for matching contributions based on the amount of employee contributions under the U.S. qualified defined contribution and non-qualified deferred compensation plans in 2020. Prior to 2020, the contributions were discretionary and we expensed $379 million in 2019 and $372 million in 2018.U.S. Retiree Medical PlanUpon retirement, we provide certain benefits to eligible U.S. employees who were hired prior to 2014 under the U.S. Retiree Medical Plan. The benefits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase eligible coverage in a medical plan.As of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the projected benefit obligation was $741 million and $633 million, which used the discount rate of 2.4% and 3.3%. The December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 corresponding fair value of plan assets was $600 million and $553 million.The investment strategy for U.S. Retiree Medical Plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The assets are invested solely in a tax-aware global equity portfolio, which is actively managed by an external investment manager. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries. As of December 26, 2020, substantially all of the U.S. Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs.The estimated benefit payments for this plan over the next 10 years are as follows: (In Millions)202120222023202420252026-2030Postretirement Medical Benefits$37 $38 $39 $40 $41 $218 Pension Benefit PlansWe provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain countries, most significantly the U.S., Ireland, Israel, and Germany.

Changes in actuarial gains and losses in the projected benefit obligation are generally driven by discount rate movement. We use the corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized on a straight-line basis.Assumptions for Pension Benefit PlansDec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligationsDiscount rate1.9 %2.3 %Rate of compensation increase3.2 %3.5 %202020192018Weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine costsDiscount rate2.3 %3.4 %3.0 %Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets3.3 %4.7 %4.7 %Rate of compensation increase3.2 %3.5 %3.3 %We establish the discount rate for each pension plan by analyzing current market long-term bond rates and matching the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension liabilities. We establish the long-term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements103Table of ContentsFundingOur practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and regulations. Additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate. Funding for the U.S. Retiree Medical Plan is discretionary under applicable laws and regulations; additional funding may be provided as deemed appropriate.On a worldwide basis, our pension and retiree medical plans were 61% funded as of December 26, 2020. The U.S. Pension Plan, which accounts for 31% of the worldwide pension and retiree medical benefit obligations, was 89% funded. Funded status is not indicative of our ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to fund retirement trusts. Required pension funding for U.S. retirement plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, which sets required minimum contributions. Cumulative company funding to the U.S. Pension Plan currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding requirements.Net Periodic Benefit CostThe net periodic benefit cost for pension and U.S. retiree medical benefits was $164 million in 2020 ($135 million in 2019 and $197 million in 2018).

The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are approximately 90% fixed income and 10% equity investments. During 2020, the U.S. Pension Plan assets were invested in collective investment trust funds, which are measured at net asset value. Non-U.S. Plan AssetsThe investments of the non-U.S. plans are managed by insurance companies, pension funds, or third-party trustees, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. Investments managed by qualified insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we have discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, either through index funds or direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market risk and to help ensure that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as they come due. The target allocation of the non-U.S. plan assets that we have control over was approximately 45% fixed income, 35% equity, and 20% hedge fund investments in 2020.The equity investments in the non-U.S. plan assets are invested in a diversified mix of equities of developed countries, including the U.S., and emerging markets throughout the world.We have control over the investment strategy related to the majority of the assets measured at net asset value, which are invested in hedge funds, bond index funds, and equity index funds.Estimated Future Benefit Payments for Pension Benefit PlansEstimated benefit payments over the next 10 years are as follows:(In Millions)202120222023202420252026-2030Pension benefits$158 $151 $155 $149 $154 $814  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements104Table of ContentsNote 18 : Employee Equity Incentive PlansOur equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. Our plans include our 2006 Plan and our 2006 ESPP.Under the 2006 Plan, 866 million shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through June 2023. As of December 26, 2020, 193 million shares of common stock remained available for future grants.Under the 2006 Plan, we grant RSUs and stock options. We grant RSUs with a service condition as well as RSUs with a market condition, performance condition, and a service condition, which we call PSUs. Prior to 2019, we granted OSUs, which were RSUs with only market and service conditions. PSUs are granted to a group of senior officers and employees. For PSUs granted in 2020, the number of shares of our common stock to be received at vesting will range from 0% to 200% of the target grant amount, equally based on two metrics: our three-year cumulative non-GAAP EPS growth relative to a target rate and TSR of our common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of the S&P 500 IT Sector Index over a three-year period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. As of December 26, 2020, 12 million PSUs and OSUs were outstanding. PSUs vest three years from the grant date, and OSUs, which were granted prior to 2019, generally vest three years and one month from the grant date. Other RSU awards and option awards generally vest over four years from the grant date. Stock options generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. Share-Based CompensationShare-based compensation recognized in 2020 was $1.9 billion ($1.7 billion in 2019 and $1.5 billion in 2018). During 2020, the tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction from share-based awards totaled $380 million ($359 million in 2019 and $399 million in 2018).We estimate the fair value of RSUs with a service condition or performance condition using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our shares of common stock prior to vesting. We estimate the fair value of RSUs with a market condition using a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the date of grant using historical volatility. Restricted Stock UnitsWeighted average assumptions used in estimating grant values were as follows:Dec 26, 2020Dec 28, 2019Dec 29, 2018Estimated values$54.82 $48.06 $48.95 Risk-free interest rate0.4 %2.3 %2.4 %Dividend yield2.3 %2.5 %2.4 %Volatility30 %25 %22 %Summary of activities:Number ofStock Units(In Millions)Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair ValueDecember 28, 201984.1 $43.86 Granted40.4 $54.82 Vested(33.3)$40.54 Forfeited(8.5)$47.89 December 26, 202082.7 $50.14 Expected to vest76.7 $50.06 The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2020 was $1.9 billion ($1.9 billion in 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018), which represents the market value of our common stock on the date that the RSUs vested. The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2020 was $1.3 billion ($1.3 billion in 2019 and $1.2 billion in 2018). The number of RSUs vested includes shares of common stock that we withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. RSUs that are expected to vest are net of estimated future forfeitures.As of December 26, 2020, unrecognized compensation costs related to RSUs granted under our equity incentive plans were $2.4 billion. We expect to recognize those costs over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.Stock Purchase PlanThe 2006 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the value of our common stock on specific dates. Under the 2006 ESPP, 523 million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance through August 2026. As of December 26, 2020, 249 million shares of common stock remained available for issuance. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements105Table of ContentsEmployees purchased 21 million shares of common stock in 2020 for $876 million under the 2006 ESPP (17 million shares of common stock for $688 million in 2019 and 14 million shares of common stock for $468 million in 2018). As of December 26, 2020, unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire shares of common stock under the 2006 ESPP totaled $48 million. We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately two months.Note 19 : Commitments and ContingenciesLeasesWe recognized leased assets in other long-term assets of $604 million and corresponding accrued liabilities of $173 million, and other long-term liabilities of $354 million as of December 26, 2020. Our leases have remaining terms of 1 to 15 years and may include options to extend the leases for up to 38 years. The weighted average remaining lease term was 4.5 years, and the weighted average discount rate was 2.5% as of December 26, 2020. Lease expense was $416 million in 2020 ($185 million in 2019 and $231 million in 2018), including $237 million in variable lease expense in 2020. Discounted and undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable leases as of December 26, 2020, excluding non-lease components, were as follows:(In Millions)20212022202320242025 ThereafterTotalLease payments$175 $133 $96 $69 $52 $34 $559 Present value of lease payments$527 CommitmentsCommitments for construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment totaled $8.6 billion as of December 26, 2020 ($10.9 billion as of December 28, 2019), a substantial majority of which will be due within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations and commitments totaled approximately $2.6 billion as of December 26, 2020 (approximately $2.8 billion as of December 28, 2019). Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services. Legal ProceedingsWe are a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. Although management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time.European Commission Competition MatterIn 2001, the EC commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. We received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC and we responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged \"conditional rebates and payments\" that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged \"payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.\" The EC imposed a fine in the amount of €1.1 billion ($1.4 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to \"immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in\" the EC decision.The EC decision contained no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision stated that we should \"cease and desist\" from further conduct that, in the EC's opinion, would violate applicable law. We took steps, which are subject to the EC's ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We had discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices.We appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our appeal took place in July 2012. In June 2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its entirety. In August 2014, we filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In November 2014, Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed comments in support of Intel's grounds of appeal. The EC and interveners filed briefs in November 2014, we filed a reply in February 2015, and the EC filed a rejoinder in April 2015. The Court of Justice held oral argument in June 2016. In October 2016, Advocate General Wahl, an advisor to the Court of Justice, issued a non-binding advisory opinion that favored Intel on a number of grounds. The Court of Justice issued its decision in September 2017, setting aside the judgment of the General Court and sending the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. The General Court has appointed a panel of five judges to consider our  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements106Table of Contentsappeal of the EC's 2009 decision in light of the Court of Justice’s clarifications of the law. In November 2017, the parties filed initial \"Observations\" about the Court of Justice's decision and the appeal and were invited by the General Court to offer supplemental comments to each other's \"Observations,\" which the parties submitted in March 2018. Responses to other questions posed by the General Court were filed in May and June 2018. The General Court heard oral argument in March 2020. Pending the final decision in this matter, the fine paid by Intel has been placed by the EC in commercial bank accounts where it accrues interest.Litigation Related to Security VulnerabilitiesIn June 2017, a Google research team notified us and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities (now commonly referred to as \"Spectre\" and \"Meltdown\") that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. On January 3, 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel and, in certain cases, our current and former executives and directors, in U.S. federal and state courts and in certain courts in other countries relating to the Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities, as well as other variants of these vulnerabilities that have since been identified.As of January 20, 2021, consumer class action lawsuits relating to the above class of security vulnerabilities publicly disclosed since 2018 were pending in the U.S., Canada, and Israel. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the U.S., numerous individual class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated in April 2018 for all pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. In March 2020, the court granted Intel's motion to dismiss the complaint in that consolidated action but granted plaintiffs leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in May 2020, which Intel moved to dismiss in July 2020; argument on the motion was heard in December 2020. In Canada, in one case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled. In a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec, the court has stayed the case until January 2021. In Israel, two consumer class action lawsuits were filed in the District Court of Haifa. In the first case, the District Court denied the parties' joint motion to stay filed in January 2019, but to date has deferred Intel's deadline to respond to the complaint. Intel filed a motion to stay the second case pending resolution of the consolidated proceeding in the U.S., and a hearing on that motion has been scheduled for November 2020. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters.In addition to these lawsuits, Intel stockholders filed multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits since January 2018 against certain current and former members of our Board of Directors and certain current and former officers, alleging that the defendants breached their duties to Intel in connection with the disclosure of the security vulnerabilities and the failure to take action in relation to alleged insider trading. The complaints sought to recover damages from the defendants on behalf of Intel. Some of the derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and were consolidated, and the others were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California in San Mateo County and were consolidated. The federal court granted defendants' motion to dismiss in August 2018 on the ground that plaintiffs failed to plead facts sufficient to show they were excused from making a pre-lawsuit demand on the Board. The federal court granted plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, but subsequently dismissed the cases in January 2019 at plaintiffs' request. The California Superior Court entered judgment in defendants' favor in August 2020 after granting defendants' motions to dismiss plaintiffs' consolidated complaint and three successive amended complaints, all for failure to plead facts sufficient to show plaintiffs were excused from making pre-lawsuit demand on the Board. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the California court's judgment in October 2020. In January 2021, another Intel stockholder filed a derivative lawsuit in the Superior Court in San Mateo County against certain current and former officers and members of our Board of Directors. The lawsuit asserts claims similar to those dismissed in August 2020, except that it alleges that the stockholder made a pre-lawsuit demand on our Board of Directors and that the demand was wrongfully refused. Defendants have not yet responded.Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences v. Intel China, Ltd., et al.In February 2018, the Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMECAS) sued Intel China, Ltd., Dell China, Ltd. (Dell) and Beijing JingDong Century Information Technology, Ltd. (JD) for patent infringement in the Beijing High Court. IMECAS alleges that Intel Core processors infringe Chinese patent CN 102956457 ('457 Patent). The complaint demands an injunction and damages of at least RMB 200 million plus the cost of litigation. A trial date is not yet set. In March 2018, Dell tendered indemnity to Intel, which Intel granted in April 2018. JD also tendered indemnity to Intel, which Intel granted in October 2018. In March 2018, Intel filed an invalidation request on the '457 patent with the Chinese Patent Reexamination Board (PRB). The PRB held an oral hearing in September 2018 and in February 2019 upheld the validity of the challenged claims. In January 2020, Intel filed a second invalidation request on the '457 patent with the PRB, for which the PRB heard oral argument in July 2020 and in November 2020 held the challenged apparatus claims invalid. In December 2020, Intel filed a third invalidation request on the '457 patent with the PRB. In September 2018 and March 2019, Intel filed petitions with the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) requesting institution of inter partes review (IPR) of U.S. Patent No. 9,070,719, the U.S. counterpart to the '457 patent. The USPTO denied institution of Intel's petitions in March and October 2019, respectively. In April 2019, Intel filed a request for rehearing and a petition for a Precedential Opinion Panel (POP) in the USPTO to challenge the denial of its first IPR petition, and in November 2019 Intel filed a request for rehearing on the second IPR petition. In January 2020, the USPTO denied the POP petition on the first IPR petition. In June 2020, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board denied Intel's rehearing requests on both petitions. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements107Table of ContentsIn October 2019, IMECAS filed second and third lawsuits in the Beijing IP Court, alleging infringement of Chinese Patent No. CN 102386226 ('226 Patent) based on the manufacturing and sale of Intel® Core i3 microprocessors. Defendants in the second case are Lenovo (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (Lenovo) and Beijing Jiayun Huitong Technology Development Co. Ltd. (BJHT). Defendants in the third case are Intel Corp., Intel China Co., Ltd., the Intel China Beijing Branch, Beijing Digital China Co., Ltd. (Digital China), and JD. Both complaints demand injunctions plus litigation costs and reserve the right to claim damages in unspecified amounts. No proceedings have occurred or are yet scheduled in these lawsuits. In December 2019, Lenovo tendered indemnity to Intel, which Intel granted in March 2020. In July 2020, Intel filed two invalidation requests on the '226 patent with the Chinese PRB. The PRB heard oral argument in December 2020.Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, the unspecified nature and extent of damages claimed by IMECAS, and uncertainty regarding the availability of injunctive relief under applicable law, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters. We dispute IMECAS's claims and intend to vigorously defend against them.VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against Intel in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging infringement of eight patents acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). The patents, which originated at Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. and NXP B.V., are U.S. Patent Nos. 7,268,588; 7,675,806; 7,706,207; 7,709,303; 8,004,922; 8,020,014; 8,268,672; and 8,566,836. VLSI accuses various FPGA and processor products of infringement. VLSI estimated its damages to be as high as $7.1 billion, and its complaint further sought enhanced damages, future royalties, attorneys' fees, costs, and interest. In May, June, September, and October 2018, Intel filed IPR petitions challenging the patentability of claims in all eight of the patents in-suit. The PTAB instituted review of six patents and denied institution on two patents. As a result of the institution decisions, the parties stipulated to stay the District Court action in March 2019. In December 2019 and February 2020, the PTAB found all claims of the '588 and '303 patents, and some claims of the '922 patent, to be unpatentable. The PTAB found the challenged claims of the '014, '672 and '207 patents to be patentable. Intel moved for a continuation of the stay in March 2020 as it appealed certain rulings by the PTAB. In June 2020, the District Court issued an order continuing the stay through August 2021 and setting trial for December 2022.In June 2018, VLSI filed a second suit against Intel, in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement by various Intel processors of five additional patents acquired from NXP: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,212,663; 7,246,027; 7,247,552; 7,523,331; and 8,081,026. VLSI accused Intel of willful infringement and seeks an injunction or, in the alternative, ongoing royalties, enhanced damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and interest. In March 2019, the District Court dismissed VLSI's claims for willful infringement as to all the patents-in-suit except the '027 patent, and also dismissed VLSI's allegations of indirect infringement as to the '633, '331, and '026 patents. In June 2019, Intel filed IPR petitions challenging the patentability of claims in all five patents-in-suit. In January 2020, the District Court vacated the November 2020 trial date based on agreement of the parties; no trial date is currently set. In January and February 2020, the PTAB instituted review of the '552, '633, '331 and '026 patents and as a result, Intel moved for stay of the District Court proceedings. In May 2020, the District Court stayed the case as to the '026 and '552 patents but allowed the case to proceed on the '027 and '331 patents. For these two patents, VLSI is seeking damages of approximately $4.13 billion plus enhanced damages for the '027 patent. VLSI is no longer asserting claims from the '633 patent. In March 2019, VLSI filed a third suit against Intel, also in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of six more patents acquired from NXP: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,366,522; 6,663,187; 7,292,485; 7,606,983; 7,725,759; and 7,793,025. In April 2019, VLSI voluntarily dismissed this Delaware case without prejudice. In April 2019, VLSI filed three new infringement suits against Intel in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas (WDTX) accusing various Intel processors of infringement. The three suits collectively assert the same six patents from the voluntarily dismissed Delaware case plus two additional patents acquired from NXP, U.S. Patent Nos. 7,523,373 and 8,156,357. VLSI accuses Intel of willful infringement and seeks an injunction or, in the alternative, ongoing royalties, enhanced damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and interest. Specifically, VLSI is seeking damages of approximately $11 billion collectively in the Texas cases, plus enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement. In the first Texas case, VLSI is asserting the '373 and '759 patents. (In December 2020, the court granted Intel summary judgment of non-infringement on the '357 patent.) VLSI seeks approximately $2.5 billion plus enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement in that case. That case was originally scheduled for trial in November 2020, but the court has now moved trial to February 2021. In October and November 2019 and in February 2020, Intel filed IPR petitions on certain asserted claims across six of the patents-in-suit in WDTX. Between May and October 2020, the PTAB denied all of these requests, and Intel has requested a rehearing, as well as a review from the Precedential Opinion Panel (POP), as to all petitions. All requests for POP review were denied in October and December 2020, and in December 2020 requests for rehearing were denied as to petitions filed on the '373 and '759 patents.In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserts Chinese Patent 201410094015.9 accusing certain Intel Core processors of infringement. VLSI requests an injunction as well as RMB 1.3 million in damages. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the PRB, but no hearing date has been set. In May 2020, defendants filed a motion to stay the trial court proceedings pending a determination on invalidity. The court has not yet ruled on the motion to stay. The court held the first evidentiary hearing in November 2020.In May 2019, VLSI filed a second case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserts Chinese Patent 201080024173.7. VLSI accuses certain Intel core processors and seeks an injunction. Defendants filed with the PRB an invalidation petition in October 2019. No hearing date has been set. In June 2020, defendants filed a motion to stay the trial court proceedings pending a determination on invalidity. The court has not yet ruled on the motion to stay. The court held its first evidentiary hearing in September 2020. The Court held a second evidentiary hearing and trial in December 2020 and has not yet issued a ruling. Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements108Table of ContentsIn November 2019, Intel, along with Apple Inc., filed a complaint against Fortress Investment Group LLC, Fortress Credit Co. LLC, Uniloc 2017 LLC, Uniloc USA, Inc., Uniloc Luxembourg S.A.R.L., VLSI, INVT SPE LLC, Inventergy Global, Inc., DSS Technology Management, Inc., IXI IP, LLC, and Seven Networks, LLC. Plaintiffs allege violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act by certain defendants, Section 7 of the Clayton Act by certain defendants, and California Business and Professions Code section 17200 by all defendants based on defendants' unlawful aggregation of patents. In February 2020, defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint. In July 2020, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss with leave to amend. The court dismissed antitrust claims related to two DSS patents with prejudice. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in August 2020, and defendants moved to dismiss in September 2020. The court heard defendants' motion to dismiss the amended complaint in December 2020 and granted the motion in January 2021, with leave to further amend.In June 2020, affiliates controlled by Fortress Investment Group, which also controls VLSI, acquired Finjan Holdings, Inc. Intel had signed a \"Settlement, Release and Patent License Agreement\" with Finjan in 2012, acquiring a license to the patents of Finjan and its affiliates, current or future, through a capture period of November 20, 2022. The agreement also contains covenants wherein Finjan agrees to cause its affiliates to comply with the agreement. As such, Intel maintains that it now has a license to the patents of VLSI, which has become a Finjan affiliate, and that Finjan must cause VLSI to dismiss its suits against Intel. In August 2020, Intel started dispute resolution proceedings under the agreement. As a part of this dispute resolution process, Intel and Finjan held a mediation in December 2020, but failed to resolve their differences. Intel filed suit to enforce its rights under the License Agreement with Finjan in January 2021 in Delaware Chancery Court. In September 2020, Intel filed motions to stay the Texas, Delaware, and Shanghai matters pending resolution of its dispute with Finjan. In November 2020, Intel filed a motion to stay the Shenzhen matter pending resolution of its dispute with Finjan. In November 2020, the Delaware Court denied Intel's motion to stay. The other stay motions remain pending. Finally, Intel filed a motion to amend its answer in the Texas matters to add a license defense in November 2020. The Court has yet to rule on the motion.Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters. We dispute VLSI's claims and intend to vigorously defend against them.Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay AnnouncementStarting in July 2020, five securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Intel and certain current and former officers based on Intel’s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent classes of acquirers of Intel stock between October 2019 and July 2020, generally allege that the defendants violated securities laws by making false and misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products in light of subsequently announced delays. In October 2020, the court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs, and in January 2021 the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. We dispute the claims described above and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that the proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these matters.In addition to the securities lawsuits, several Intel stockholders have filed derivative lawsuits against certain members of our Board of Directors and certain current and former officers based on Intel’s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The complaints, which were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in December 2020, allege that defendants breached their fiduciary duties to Intel by either making or allowing the company to make alleged misstatements about the timeline for 7nm products during the class period alleged in the securities litigation. Certain of the complaints also allege claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaints seek to recover damages on behalf of Intel. Defendants have not yet responded.  Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements109Table of ContentsKey TermsWe use terms throughout our document that are specific to Intel or that are abbreviations that may not be commonly known or used.

A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our employees are working from home. Established business continuity plans remain activated to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data, and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allows for remote execution with accessibility to secure data.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on management's evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 26, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Management’s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment.Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting, as stated in the firm's attestation report, which is included within Financial Statements and Supplemental Details.
