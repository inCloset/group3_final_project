Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:•users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;•we fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;•users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, format, size, and quality of ads that we display;•users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;•user behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services;•we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;15Table of Contents•there are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our user data practices, concerns about the nature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to privacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;•we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is appropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant to them;•we are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;•we are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our products;•users adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may not be featured or otherwise available;•there are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely affect our products or users;•we are unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, or are otherwise limited in our business operations, as a result of European courts invalidating the EU-U.S. DPF or regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that the legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States are invalid;•there is decreased engagement with our products, decreased efficiency of our advertising products, or failure to accept our terms of service, as part of changes that we have implemented or may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, in connection with the GDPR, the European Union's ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, the DMCC, U.S. state privacy laws including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA), youth social media laws, or other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise;•technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or otherwise objectionable content, or users feel their experience is diminished as a result of our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our platform; •we adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or we take, or fail to take, actions to enforce our policies, that result in our removal of users from our platform or are perceived negatively by our users or the general public, including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board regarding content on our platform;•we elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth and engagement (for example, we have announced plans to focus product decisions on optimizing the young adult experience in the long term);•we make changes in our user account login or registration processes or changes in how we promote different products and services across our family of products;•initiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement, including the use of evolving technologies such as generative artificial intelligence, are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of actions by us, our competitors, or other third parties, or otherwise;•third-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans, are scaled back or discontinued, or the pricing of data plans otherwise increases;•there is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other mobile applications in certain countries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the accessibility of our products in their countries (for example, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, our user growth and engagement were adversely affected by the war in Ukraine and service restrictions imposed by the Russian government);•we fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;16Table of Contents•we, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user data practices; or•our current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build, grow, and monetize applications, reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for our users to interact and share on third-party applications.From time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to varying degrees. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the demand for our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed.Our advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:•decreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;•our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;•product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products;•our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;•our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;•changes to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;•adverse litigation, government actions, or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising, including developments that may impact certain advertisers' ability to advertise on our platform or our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;•user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we monetize at a higher rate, such as our Feed and Stories products, including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video or messaging products;•reductions of advertising due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the security and integrity of our platform or that we believe are needed to comply with global content, security, or integrity obligations;17Table of Contents•the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;•loss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if competitors offer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;•limitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe as a result of European courts invalidating the EU-U.S. DPF or regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that the legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States are invalid;•limitations on our ability to deliver ads to users under the age of 18 and, in some cases, to continue to offer certain products or services to certain cohorts of users, whether voluntarily, as a result of new laws, regulations, or government actions in the United States and other jurisdictions, or otherwise;•changes in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of risks related to complying with laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;•decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of announcements by us or adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our products, our interpretation, implementation, or enforcement of policies relating to content on our products (including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with applications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;•reductions of advertising by marketers due to illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable content made available on our products by third parties, questions about our user data practices or the security of our platform, concerns about brand safety or potential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding regulatory developments or their own legal and compliance obligations, including with respect to artificial intelligence;•the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users consent to, opt out of, or reduce the use of data for ads, including as a result of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DMCC, U.S. state privacy laws including the CCPA, and other laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or litigation, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for advertising purposes (for example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we began offering our users a "subscription for no ads" alternative in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland, and subsequently in November 2024 provided users in those regions who elect to continue receiving our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads);•the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;•changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;•the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;•changes in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and•the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among specific types of marketers or within particular geographies, which in turn can have broader effects in other regions (for example, the war in Ukraine and service restrictions imposed by the Russian government have adversely affected our advertising business in Europe and other regions, and advertiser spending also can be subject to adverse effects from conflicts in the Middle East or the implementation of tariffs by the United States, China, or other governments).From time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California January 29, 202585Table of ContentsMETA PLATFORMS, INC.
